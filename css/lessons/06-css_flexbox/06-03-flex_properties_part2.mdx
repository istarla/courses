# Flex Container Properties (Part 2)

Yesterday, we began exploring flex container properties, covering
flex-direction, flex-wrap,
flex-flow, and justify-content. Today, we
continue our journey with two more crucial properties for aligning flex
items: `align-items` (for single lines) and
`align-content` (for multiple lines created by
`flex-wrap: wrap`).

Items for `align-items` examples (varying heights):

Item 1 (short)

Item 2 (tall)

Item 3 (medium)

Items for `align-content` examples (many items to wrap):

## 5. align-items


The `align-items` property defines how flex items are aligned
along the **cross axis** of the current line in the flex
container. Think of it as the `justify-content` equivalent
for the cross axis.

Possible values:

* **`stretch`** (default): Flex items are
  stretched to fill the container's height (if
  `flex-direction: row`) or width (if
  `flex-direction: column`), provided they don't have a fixed
  dimension on the cross axis (e.g., a set `height` for
  rows).
* **`flex-start`**: Items are packed toward the start of the cross axis.
* **`flex-end`**: Items are packed toward the end of the cross axis.
* **`center`**: Items are centered along the cross axis.
* **`baseline`**: Items are aligned such that their baselines align. The baseline is
  typically the imaginary line upon which text sits.

For these examples, assume `flex-direction: row;` (main axis
is horizontal, cross axis is vertical).

**Example: `align-items: stretch;` (Default - if items have
no set height)**

Item 1

Item 2

Item 3

**Example: `align-items: flex-start;` (Items with varying
heights)**

1 (short)

2 (tall)

3 (medium)

**Example: `align-items: flex-end;`**

1 (short)

2 (tall)

3 (medium)

**Example: `align-items: center;`**

1 (short)

2 (tall)

3 (medium)

**Example: `align-items: baseline;`**

```css
.my-flex-container {
  display: flex;
  height: 200px; /* Give container height to see alignment */
  align-items: center; /* Aligns children to the vertical center of the container */
}
.another-container {
  display: flex;
  height: 150px;
  align-items: flex-start; /* Aligns children to the top of the container */
}
```

## 6. align-content


The `align-content` property is used to align multiple lines
of flex items along the **cross axis** when there is extra
space in the flex container. This property only has an effect when
`flex-wrap` is set to `wrap` or
`wrap-reverse` and there are multiple lines of flex items.

If there's only one line of flex items, `align-content` has
no effect.

Possible values (similar to `justify-content`, but for the
cross axis with multiple lines):

* **`stretch`** (default): Lines stretch to take
  up the remaining space.
* **`flex-start`**: Lines are packed to the start of the cross axis.
* **`flex-end`**: Lines are packed to the end of the cross axis.
* **`center`**: Lines are packed to the center of the cross axis.
* **`space-between`**: Lines are evenly distributed; the first line is at the start of the
  cross axis, the last line is at the end.
* **`space-around`**: Lines are evenly distributed with equal space around each line.
* **`space-evenly`**: Lines are evenly distributed with equal space between them and to
  the edges of the container.

For these examples, container is
`flex-wrap: wrap; height: 300px; width: 250px;` with 6 items
(60px wide, 40px tall each).

```css
.multi-line-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap; /* Required for align-content to have an effect */
  height: 400px; /* Must have extra space in the cross-axis */
  align-content: space-around; /* Distributes lines with space around them */
}
.item {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  margin: 5px;
}
```

It's easy to confuse `align-items` and
`align-content`.
**`align-items`** works on single lines of
flex items, aligning the items \*within\* that line along the cross
axis. **`align-content`** works when there are
\*multiple lines\* of flex items (due to wrapping), aligning those lines
themselves within the flex container along the cross axis. If there's
only one line, `align-content` has no effect.
