# Introduction to Flexbox


Welcome to Week 6, where we dive into modern CSS layout techniques!
Today, we introduce the **Flexible Box Layout Module**,
commonly known as **Flexbox**. Flexbox is a one-dimensional
layout model designed to provide a more efficient way to arrange, align,
and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is
unknown or dynamic.

## Why Flexbox?


Before Flexbox, creating complex layouts (especially responsive ones)
often involved using floats, table display properties, or absolute
positioning, which could be cumbersome and lead to fragile designs
(e.g., requiring clearfix hacks).

Flexbox aims to solve these problems by offering:

* **One-dimensional layout:** It deals with layout in a
  single dimension at a time – either as a row or as a column.
* **Content-out or Layout-in:** It can manage items based
  on their content size or distribute space according to the layout
  rules.
* **Alignment and Distribution:** Powerful alignment
  capabilities for items along both main and cross axes.
* **Order Independence:** The visual order of items can be
  different from their source order in HTML.
* **Responsiveness:** Items can "flex" (grow or shrink) to
  fill available space or adapt to different screen sizes.

## Core Flexbox Terminology

Understanding Flexbox requires familiarity with its key terms:

* **Flex Container:** The parent element on which
  `display: flex;` or `display: inline-flex;` is
  applied.
* **Flex Items:** The direct children of the flex
  container.
* **Main Axis:** The primary axis along which flex items
  are laid out. By default, this is horizontal (row direction), but it
  can be changed to vertical (column direction) using the
  `flex-direction` property.
* **Cross Axis:** The axis perpendicular to the main axis.
  If the main axis is horizontal, the cross axis is vertical, and
  vice-versa.
* **Main Start / Main End:** The beginning and end points
  of the main axis.
* **Cross Start / Cross End:** The beginning and end points
  of the cross axis.
* **Main Size:** The width or height of a flex item,
  depending on whether the main axis is horizontal or vertical.
* **Cross Size:** The width or height of a flex item,
  depending on whether the cross axis is horizontal or vertical.
      <div class="axis-illustration">
        <p>
          Imagine a container (Flex Container). Its direct children are Flex
          Items.
        </p>
        <p>If <code>flex-direction: row;</code> (default):</p>
        <p>
          <span class="main-axis">Main Axis: Horizontal (left to right)</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="cross-axis">Cross Axis: Vertical (top to bottom)</span>
        </p>
        <p>If <code>flex-direction: column;</code>:</p>
        <p>
          <span class="main-axis">Main Axis: Vertical (top to bottom)</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="cross-axis">Cross Axis: Horizontal (left to right)</span>
        </p>
      </div>



## Enabling Flexbox: The `display` Property

To start using Flexbox, you apply the `display` property to
the container element:

* **`display: flex;`**: This makes the element a block-level flex container. It will take
  up the full available width like a regular block element.
* **`display: inline-flex;`**: This makes the element an inline-level flex container. It will only
  take up as much space as its content requires, like a regular
  inline-block element.

Once either of these is applied, the direct children of that element
become flex items.

## Basic Flex Container Example

      <div class="example-html">
        <div class="flex-container-demo">
          <div class="flex-item-demo">Item 1</div>
          <div class="flex-item-demo">Item 2</div>
          <div class="flex-item-demo">Item 3</div>
        </div>
      </div>

```html
<div class="flex-container">
  <div class="flex-item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="flex-item">Item 2</div>
  <div class="flex-item">Item 3</div>
</div>
```

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex; /* Makes this div a flex container */
  background-color: lightblue;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 1px solid blue;
}

.flex-item {
  background-color: navy;
  color: white;
  padding: 20px;
  margin: 5px;
  border: 1px solid darkblue;
  text-align: center;
}
```

In the example above, without any other flex properties, the items will
line up in a row (the default `flex-direction`) and will not
wrap. They might shrink to fit if their combined width exceeds the
container width, or they might overflow.

## Flex Container Properties vs. Flex Item Properties

Flexbox has a set of properties that apply to the
**flex container** (to control how its children are laid
out) and another set of properties that apply to the
**flex items** themselves (to control how they behave
within the container).

**Upcoming topics:**

* **Tomorrow (Day 27 & 28):** We will explore key
  **Flex Container Properties** like:
  + `flex-direction` (row, column, etc.)
  + `flex-wrap` (nowrap, wrap, wrap-reverse)
  + `flex-flow` (shorthand for direction and wrap)
  + `justify-content` (aligning items along the main axis)
  + `align-items` (aligning items along the cross axis)
  + `align-content` (aligning multiple lines of items along
    the cross axis)
* **Later this week (Day 29 & 30):** We will look at
  **Flex Item Properties** like:
  + `order`
  + `flex-grow`
  + `flex-shrink`
  + `flex-basis`
  + `flex` (shorthand for grow, shrink, and basis)
  + `align-self`

Flexbox is a powerful tool, and its true potential is unlocked when
you combine container and item properties effectively. We will build
up this understanding step-by-step.
