## Flex Item Properties (Part 1)

We've spent the last two days focusing on properties for the flex
container. Now, we shift our attention to the
**flex items** themselves. These properties control how
individual items behave within the flex container, including their
order, ability to grow or shrink, and their initial size.

Today we'll cover `order`, `flex-grow`,
`flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`.

      <div className="example-html">
  <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-2">
    Default HTML structure for examples (unless specified):
  </p>
  <div
    className="flex-container"
    id="itemPropsContainerTemplate"
    style={{ display: "none" }}
  >
    <div className="flex-item item1">Item 1</div>
    <div className="flex-item item2">Item 2</div>
    <div className="flex-item item3">Item 3</div>
  </div>
</div>


## 1. order


The `order` property controls the order in which flex items
appear within the flex container. By default, items are laid out in
their source order (as they appear in the HTML).

* Accepts an integer value (positive, negative, or zero).
* Default value is `0`.
* Items with lower `order` values appear first. Items with
  the same `order` value are laid out in source order.
* This property allows you to change the visual order without altering
  the HTML structure, which can be useful for responsiveness or
  accessibility considerations (though be mindful that source order
  still matters for things like tab navigation).

**Example: Default Order (all items `order: 0`)**

      <div className="flex-container order-default">
  <div className="flex-item item1">Item 1 (order:0)</div>
  <div className="flex-item item2">Item 2 (order:0)</div>
  <div className="flex-item item3">Item 3 (order:0)</div>
</div>

**Example: Modified Order**

      <div className="flex-container order-modified">
  <div className="flex-item item1">Item 1 (order:2)</div>
  <div className="flex-item item2">Item 2 (order:1)</div>
  <div className="flex-item item-neg">Item Neg (order:-1)</div>
  <div className="flex-item item3">Item 3 (order:3)</div>
</div>


```css
.flex-container { display: flex; }
.item-first { order: -1; } /* Will appear first */
.item-default { order: 0; } /* Default, or explicitly set */
.item-last { order: 1; }  /* Will appear after items with order 0 or -1 */

.original-item-A { /* HTML: A, B, C */ }
.original-item-B { order: -1; } /* Visual: B, A, C */
.original-item-C { }
```

## 2. flex-grow

The `flex-grow` property defines the ability of a flex item
to grow if necessary. It specifies what proportion of the remaining
space in the flex container should be distributed to the item.

* Accepts a unitless non-negative number (e.g., `0`,
  `1`, `2`).
* Default value is `0` (meaning the item will not grow to
  fill available space).
* If all items have `flex-grow: 1`, the remaining space is
  distributed equally among them.
* If one item has `flex-grow: 2` and others have
  `flex-grow: 1`, the item with
  `flex-grow: 2` will take up twice as much of the available
  space as the others.

This property is applied after items have been sized according to
`flex-basis` (and `width`/`height`). It
only has an effect if there is positive free space in the flex
container.

**Example: Items with `flex-grow`**

      <div className="flex-container grow-example">
  <div
    className="flex-item"
    style={{ backgroundColor: "#fca5a5" }}
  >
    No Grow (0)
  </div>
  <div className="flex-item item-grow1">Grow 1</div>
  <div className="flex-item item-grow2">Grow 2</div>
</div>


```css
.flex-container { display: flex; width: 600px; } /* Container wider than sum of initial item widths */
.item { width: 100px; /* Initial width */ }
.item-a { flex-grow: 1; } /* Takes 1 part of extra space */
.item-b { flex-grow: 0; } /* Does not grow */
.item-c { flex-grow: 2; } /* Takes 2 parts of extra space */
```

## 3. flex-shrink

The `flex-shrink` property defines the ability of a flex item
to shrink if necessary (i.e., if the combined size of items is larger
than the flex container).

* Accepts a unitless non-negative number.
* Default value is `1` (meaning the item can shrink).
* A value of `0` means the item will not shrink, even if it
  causes an overflow.
* If one item has `flex-shrink: 2` and others have
  `flex-shrink: 1`, the item with
  `flex-shrink: 2` will shrink twice as much as the others
  when space is insufficient. The amount an item shrinks is also
  proportional to its `flex-basis`.

**Example: Items with `flex-shrink` (Container width 350px,
items have `flex-basis: 150px`)**

Shrink 1 (basis 150px)

No Shrink (0) (basis 150px)

Shrink 2 (basis 150px)

```css
.flex-container { display: flex; width: 300px; } /* Container narrower than sum of item widths */
.item { width: 150px; /* Initial width, acts like flex-basis if basis is auto */ }
.item-x { flex-shrink: 1; } /* Can shrink (default) */
.item-y { flex-shrink: 0; } /* Will not shrink, may overflow */
.item-z { flex-shrink: 2; } /* Will shrink more readily */
```

## 4. flex-basis

The `flex-basis` property defines the default size of a flex
item along the main axis *before* any remaining space is
distributed according to `flex-grow` or
`flex-shrink`.

* Accepts a length unit (`px`, `%`,
  `em`, etc.), or the keywords `auto` or
  `content`.
* Default value is `auto`. If `auto`, the item's
  main size property (`width` or `height`) is
  used. If that is also `auto`, it sizes based on its
  content.
* If set to a specific length (e.g., `100px`), that becomes
  its initial main size.
* The `content` keyword (newer) sizes the item based on its
  content size.
* If `flex-basis` is set to a value other than
  `auto`, it generally overrides the item's
  `width` (for rows) or `height` (for columns)
  property for the purpose of flex layout calculations.

**Example: Items with `flex-basis`**

Basis 120px

Basis auto (width 70px)

Basis content (fits this longer text)

```css
.flex-container { display: flex; }
.item-fixed-basis {
  flex-basis: 200px; /* Item wants to be 200px wide initially */
  flex-grow: 0; /* Don't grow */
  flex-shrink: 0; /* Don't shrink */
}
.item-percentage-basis {
  flex-basis: 25%; /* Item wants to be 25% of container width initially */
}
.item-auto-basis {
  flex-basis: auto; /* Uses width/height or content size */
  width: 100px; /* This will be its basis */
}
.item-content-basis {
  flex-basis: content; /* Sizes based on its content */
}
```

The interplay between `flex-basis`, `flex-grow`,
and `flex-shrink` determines the final size of a flex item.
`flex-basis` sets the starting point. Then, if there's
extra space, `flex-grow` distributes it. If there's not
enough space, `flex-shrink` determines how items shrink.

We'll cover the `flex` shorthand property tomorrow, which
combines these three.
