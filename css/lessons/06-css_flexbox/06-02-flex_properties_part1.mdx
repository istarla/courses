# Flex Container Properties (Part 1)

Yesterday, we introduced Flexbox and its core concepts. Today, we'll
start exploring the properties that can be applied to the
**flex container** to control the layout of its flex items.
We'll cover flex-direction, flex-wrap, the
flex-flow shorthand, and justify-content.

Default items for examples (3 items):

1

Some examples will use more items (5 items):

## 1. flex-direction


The `flex-direction` property establishes the main axis, thus
defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container.

Possible values:

* **`row`** (default): Flex items are laid out
  horizontally, from left to right (in LTR languages). The main axis is
  horizontal.
* **`row-reverse`**: Flex items are laid out horizontally, from right to left.
* **`column`**: Flex items are laid out vertically, from top to bottom. The main
  axis is vertical.
* **`column-reverse`**: Flex items are laid out vertically, from bottom to top.

**Example: `flex-direction: row;` (Default)**

**Example: `flex-direction: column;`**

**Example: `flex-direction: column-reverse;`**

```css
.container-row {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row; /* Main axis is horizontal, left to right */
}
.container-column-reverse {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column-reverse; /* Main axis is vertical, bottom to top */
}
```

## 2. flex-wrap


By default, flex items try to fit onto one line. The
`flex-wrap` property controls whether the flex container
should wrap its items onto multiple lines if they exceed the container's
width (for rows) or height (for columns).

Possible values:

* **nowrap** (default): Flex items will all be
  on one line. They may shrink or overflow the container if they don't
  fit.
* **wrap**: Flex items will wrap onto multiple lines if necessary, from top to
  bottom.
* **wrap-reverse**: Flex items will wrap onto multiple lines if necessary, from bottom
  to top.

**Example: `flex-wrap: nowrap;` (Default) - Container width
300px, items 60px wide each**

```css
.container-wrap {
  display: flex;
  width: 300px; /* To demonstrate wrapping with fixed-width items */
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
.flex-item {
  width: 100px; /* If container-wrap is 250px wide, 3rd item will wrap */
}
```

## 3. flex-flow (Shorthand)

The `flex-flow` property is a shorthand for setting both
`flex-direction` and `flex-wrap` properties in a
single declaration.

**Syntax:**
`flex-flow: <flex-direction> || <flex-wrap>;`

The default value is `row nowrap`.

**Example: `flex-flow: column wrap;`**

```css
.container-shorthand {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: column wrap; /* Main axis vertical, wraps items if container height is insufficient */
}
.another-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row-reverse wrap-reverse;
}
```

## 4. justify-content

The justify-content property defines how flex items are
aligned along the **main axis** of the flex container. It
helps distribute extra free space left over when all the flex items on a
line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum
size.

Possible values:

* **`flex-start`** (default): Items are packed
  toward the start of the main axis.
* **`flex-end`**: Items are packed toward the end of the main axis.
* **`center`**: Items are centered along the main axis.
* **`space-between`**: Items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the
  start line, last item on the end line. Space is only between items.
* **`space-around`**: Items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around
  them. Note that visually the spaces aren't equal because each item
  gets space on both sides, so the space between two items is double the
  space before the first and after the last.
* **`space-evenly`**: Items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items
  (and the space to the edges) is equal.

**Example: `justify-content: flex-start;` (Default)**

1

**Example: `justify-content: flex-end;`**

**Example: `justify-content: center;`**

**Example: `justify-content: space-between;`**

3

**Example: `justify-content: space-around;`**

1

2

**Example: `justify-content: space-evenly;`**

```css
.nav-menu {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row; /* Main axis is horizontal */
  justify-content: space-around; /* Distribute menu items with space around them */
  list-style: none;
  padding: 0;
}
.vertical-center-column {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column; /* Main axis is vertical */
  justify-content: center; /* Centers items vertically in this case */
  height: 300px; /* Container needs a defined height for vertical centering */
}
```

The effect of `justify-content` is most apparent when there's
extra space along the main axis. If items fill the entire main axis
(e.g., due to `flex-grow` or their natural size), some
`justify-content` values might have no visible effect.
