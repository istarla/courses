# Introduction to css
Welcome to the first day of your CSS journey! Today, we'll explore the
fundamental concepts of CSS: what it is, its basic syntax, and how to
use selectors to target HTML elements for styling.

### What is CSS?


CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. It's a
stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document
written in a markup language like HTML. CSS dictates how HTML elements
should be displayed on screen, on paper, or in other media. Essentially,
CSS is responsible for the look and feel of a web page – its layout,
colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance.

Without CSS, web pages would be plain text with unstyled HTML elements.
CSS allows developers to separate the content (HTML) from the
presentation (CSS), making websites easier to maintain, more flexible,
and capable of sophisticated designs.

### CSS Syntax


A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block:

* **Selector:** Points to the HTML element(s) you want to
  style.
* **Declaration Block:** Contains one or more declarations
  separated by semicolons. Each declaration includes a CSS property name
  and a value, separated by a colon.

Here's the basic structure:

```css
selector {
  property: value; /* This is a declaration */
  another-property: another-value; /* Another declaration */
}
```

For example, to make all paragraph (`<p>`) elements red
and have a font size of 16 pixels, the CSS rule would be:

```css
p {
  color: red;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```
