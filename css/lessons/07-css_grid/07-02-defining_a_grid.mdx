# Defining a Grid

Now that we understand the basics of CSS Grid and its terminology, let's
learn how to explicitly define the structure of our grid using the
`grid-template-columns` and
`grid-template-rows` properties, and how to control the
spacing between grid tracks using the `gap` properties.

### 1. Defining Columns: grid-template-columns

The `grid-template-columns` property defines the number and
size of the columns in your grid layout.

You provide a space-separated list of values, where each value
represents the size of a column track.

**Common Size Values:**

* **Length units:** `px`, `em`,
  `rem`, etc. (e.g., `100px 200px 100px` creates
  three columns with fixed widths).
* **Percentage units:** `%` (relative to the
  container width).
* **`auto`:** The column sizes itself based on
  its content, or takes up remaining space if other columns are fixed.
* **Fractional units (`fr`):** Represents a
  fraction of the available space in the grid container after accounting
  for fixed-size tracks and gaps. `1fr 2fr` means the second
  column gets twice as much available space as the first.
* **minmax(min, max):** Defines a size range,
  allowing the track to be flexible within limits (e.g.,
  `minmax(100px, 1fr)` means the column is at least 100px
  wide, but can grow to take 1 fraction of available space).
* **fit-content(value):** Sizes the column
  based on its content, but caps it at the specified `value`.

**Example: Fixed Width Columns**

100px

200px

100px

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 100px 200px 100px; /* 3 columns with fixed widths */
}
```

**Example: Fractional Unit Columns**

1fr

2fr

1fr

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr; /* 3 columns, middle one gets twice the space */
}
```

**Example: Mixed Units**

150px

1fr

2fr

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 150px 1fr 2fr; /* Fixed first column, remaining space split 1:2 */
}
```

## 2. Defining Rows: `grid-template-rows`

The `grid-template-rows` property works similarly to
`grid-template-columns`, but defines the number and height of
the rows in your grid.

You provide a space-separated list of row track sizes, using the same
types of values (`px`, `%`, `fr`,
`auto`, `minmax()`, etc.). Percentage heights are
relative to the container's height (which often needs to be explicitly
set).

If you define columns but not rows, the grid will create implicit rows
with `auto` height (sizing based on content) as needed.

**Example: Fixed Height Rows**

Row 1 (50px)

Row 1 (50px)

Row 2 (100px)

Row 2 (100px)

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; /* Define columns first */
  grid-template-rows: 50px 100px; /* Define two rows with fixed heights */
}
```

**Example: Auto Height Rows**

Row 1 (auto height)  
More Content

Row 1 (auto height)

Row 2 (60px height)

Row 2 (60px height)

Row 3 (auto height)

Row 3 (auto height)  
Line  
Line

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 100px 100px;
  grid-template-rows: auto 60px auto; /* Row heights based on content, except middle row */
}
```

## 3. The repeat() Function

To avoid writing out the same track size multiple times, you can use the
`repeat()` function.

**Syntax:** `repeat(count, track-size-list)`

* `count`: The number of times to repeat, or keywords like
  `auto-fill` or `auto-fit`.
* `track-size-list`: The track size(s) to repeat (e.g.,
  `1fr`, `minmax(100px, 1fr)`,
  `100px 200px`).

**Example: Repeating Columns**

1fr

1fr

1fr

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  /* Equivalent to: 1fr 1fr 1fr */
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}
```

**Example: Auto-Fitting Columns (Responsive)**

Using `auto-fill` or `auto-fit` with
`minmax()` creates responsive grids without media queries.
`auto-fill` fills the row with as many columns as possible,
even if they are empty. `auto-fit` behaves similarly but
collapses empty tracks.

Item 1

Item 2

Item 3

Item 4

Item 5

```css
.responsive-grid {
  display: grid;
  /* Create as many columns as fit, each at least 100px wide,
     growing equally to fill space */
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(100px, 1fr));
  gap: 10px;
}
```

### 4. Defining Gaps: `gap`, `row-gap`, `column-gap`

These properties define the size of the gutters (space) between grid
tracks.

* **`column-gap`**: Sets the gap between columns.
* **`row-gap`**: Sets the gap between rows.
* **`gap`**: A shorthand for setting both `row-gap` and
  `column-gap`. If one value is provided, it applies to both.
  If two values are provided, the first is `row-gap`, the
  second is `column-gap`.

(Note: These properties were previously named
`grid-column-gap`, `grid-row-gap`, and
`grid-gap`. The shorter names are now standard and also work
in Flexbox).

**Example: Uniform Gap**

1

2

3

4

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 10px; /* 10px gap between rows AND columns */
}
```

**Example: Different Row and Column Gaps**

1

2

3

4

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  row-gap: 20px; /* 20px gap between rows */
  column-gap: 5px; /* 5px gap between columns */
  /* Shorthand: gap: 20px 5px; */
}
```

The `gap` properties create space only \*between\* tracks, not
between the edge tracks and the container boundary. Use container
`padding` for that.
