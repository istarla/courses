# Introduction to CSS Grid

Welcome to Week 7! After exploring Flexbox for one-dimensional layouts,
we now turn to **CSS Grid Layout** (or simply "Grid"). Grid
is a powerful **two-dimensional** layout system for the
web, allowing you to arrange content into rows and columns. It provides
a level of control over layout that was previously difficult or
impossible to achieve with CSS alone.

## Why CSS Grid?


While Flexbox excels at arranging items along a single axis (either a
row or a column), Grid is designed for layouts involving both rows and
columns simultaneously.

Key advantages of Grid:

* **Two-Dimensional Layout:** Explicitly define columns and
  rows, creating complex grid structures.
* **Item Placement Control:** Precisely place items into
  specific grid cells or allow them to span multiple cells.
* **Alignment Capabilities:** Robust alignment options for
  both the grid itself and the items within it.
* **Gap Control:** Easily define gutters or spacing between
  grid tracks (rows/columns).
* **Reduced Need for Markup:** Complex layouts can often be
  achieved with simpler HTML structures compared to older methods.
* **Overlap:** Grid allows items to overlap if placed in
  the same grid area.

## Core Grid Terminology

Understanding Grid requires learning some specific terminology:

* **Grid Container:** The element on which
  `display: grid;` or `display: inline-grid;` is
  applied.
* **Grid Items:** The direct children of the grid
  container.
* **Grid Lines:** The dividing lines (both horizontal and
  vertical) that make up the structure of the grid. Lines are numbered
  starting from 1.
* **Grid Tracks:** The space between two adjacent grid
  lines. These are the columns or rows of the grid.
* **Grid Cell:** The space between two adjacent row lines
  and two adjacent column lines – the smallest unit in a grid.
* **Grid Area:** A total space surrounded by four grid
  lines. A grid area may be composed of any number of grid cells.
* **Gap (or Gutter):** The space between grid tracks (rows
  or columns). Defined using `gap`, `row-gap`,
  `column-gap`.

  <div class="terminology-diagram">
        <p class="font-bold">Conceptual Grid (3x2)</p>
        <p>
          Col Line 1 | Column 1 Track | Col Line 2 | Column 2 Track | Col Line 3
          | Column 3 Track | Col Line 4
        </p>
        <p>
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        </p>
        <p>Row Line 1 | Row 1 Track | (Cell 1,1) | (Cell 1,2) | (Cell 1,3) |</p>
        <p>
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        </p>
        <p>Row Line 2 | Row 2 Track | (Cell 2,1) | (Cell 2,2) | (Cell 2,3) |</p>
        <p>
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        </p>
        <p>Row Line 3</p>
        <p class="mt-2 text-sm">
          A Grid Area could span multiple cells (e.g., from Col Line 1 to 3 and
          Row Line 1 to 2).
        </p>
      </div>


A Grid Area could span multiple cells (e.g., from Col Line 1 to 3 and
Row Line 1 to 2).

## Enabling Grid Layout: The display Property

Similar to Flexbox, you enable Grid layout by applying the
`display` property to the container element:

* **`display: grid;`**: Makes the element a block-level grid container.
* **`display: inline-grid;`**: Makes the element an inline-level grid container.

Once applied, the direct children become grid items and will initially
be placed automatically into the available grid cells according to the
auto-placement algorithm (unless explicitly placed).

## Basic Grid Container Example

This example creates a simple 3-column grid. We'll learn how
     
```css
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">1</div>
  <div class="grid-item">2</div>
  <div class="grid-item">3</div>
  <div class="grid-item">4</div>
  <div class="grid-item">5</div>
  <div class="grid-item">6</div>
</div>
```

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: auto auto auto; /* Define 3 columns of automatic width */
  gap: 10px; /* 10px space between rows and columns */
  background-color: lightgreen;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 1px solid green;
}

.grid-item {
  background-color: lightseagreen;
  color: white;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 1px solid darkcyan;
  text-align: center;
}
```

In this basic setup, Grid automatically creates rows as needed to
accommodate the items within the defined columns.

## Grid vs. Flexbox: When to Use Which?

While both are powerful layout tools, they excel in different areas:

* **Use Flexbox for:** One-dimensional layouts (a single
  row or column), distributing items along that axis, content-first
  layouts where item size might dictate layout, simpler component
  layouts (like navigation bars, button groups).
* **Use Grid for:** Two-dimensional layouts (rows and
  columns simultaneously), layouts where strict alignment in both
  dimensions is critical, "layout-first" designs where the grid
  structure is defined upfront, overlapping elements.

It's also very common to **use them together**! For
example, you might use Grid for the overall page structure (header,
sidebar, main content, footer) and then use Flexbox within the header
to align the logo and navigation items.

## Upcoming Grid Topics

* **Defining Grid Tracks**
  (`grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`)
  and Gaps (`gap`).
* **Placing Items using Line Numbers**
  (`grid-column`, `grid-row`).
* **Placing Items using Named Areas**
  (`grid-template-areas`, `grid-area`) and
  Shorthands.
* **Aligning Grid Items and Tracks**
  (`justify-items`, `align-items`,
  `justify-content`, `align-content`).
