# Box Sizing
We've spent the last few days exploring the CSS box model, including
content, padding, border, and margin. Today, we'll discuss a crucial
property that controls how the total width and height of an element are
calculated: `box-sizing`. Understanding this property can
significantly simplify layout and sizing management.

## The Default: content-box

By default, the box-sizing property is set to
content-box. In this model:

* The width and height properties you set
  apply **only to the content area** of the element.
* Any padding and border values are added
  *on top of* the specified width and
  height.

This means the actual visible width of an element on the page is
calculated as:
width + padding-left + padding-right + border-left-width +
border-right-width. The same applies to height.

 box-sizing: content-box;  
 width: 250px;

```css
.my-element-content-box {
  box-sizing: content-box; /* This is the default */
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 15px;
  border: 5px solid green;
  background-color: lightgreen;
}
/*
  Actual rendered width: 200px (content) + 15px (left_pad) + 15px (right_pad) + 5px (left_border) + 5px (right_border) = 240px
  Actual rendered height: 100px (content) + 15px (top_pad) + 15px (bottom_pad) + 5px (top_border) + 5px (bottom_border) = 140px
*/
```

While this is the default, it can sometimes make layouts challenging.
For instance, if you want an element to be exactly 300px wide including
its border and padding, you'd have to manually subtract those values
from the width property, which can be tedious and
error-prone, especially in responsive designs.

## The Alternative: border-box

The box-sizing: border-box; model offers a more intuitive
way to manage element dimensions. In this model:

* The width and height properties you set
  apply to the
  **total width and height of the element, including padding and
  border**, but not margin.
* `Padding` and `border` values are drawn
  *inside* the specified `width` and
  `height`, effectively shrinking the available content area.

This means if you set width: 300px; and
box-sizing: border-box;, the element's total rendered width
(content + padding + border) will be 300px. The browser automatically
adjusts the content area to accommodate the padding and border.

box-sizing: border-box;  
width: 250px;  
padding: 20px;  
border: 10px solid ...;  
Actual rendered width: **250px**.   
(Content area becomes 250px - 40px padding - 20px border = 190px)

```css
.my-element-border-box {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 200px; /* This is now the total width including padding and border */
  height: 100px; /* This is now the total height including padding and border */
  padding: 15px;
  border: 5px solid dodgerblue;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
/*
  Actual rendered width: 200px
  Content area width: 200px - 15px (left_pad) - 15px (right_pad) - 5px (left_border) - 5px (right_border) = 160px

  Actual rendered height: 100px
  Content area height: 100px - 15px (top_pad) - 15px (bottom_pad) - 5px (top_border) - 5px (bottom_border) = 60px
*/
```

Using border-box makes it much easier to create layouts,
especially when dealing with percentage-based widths and fixed
padding/borders. For example, if you have two columns, each with
width: 50%; box-sizing: border-box;, you can add padding
and borders to them without worrying about them exceeding the 50% width
and breaking the layout.

## Universal border-box Sizing

Many developers prefer to use border-box for all elements
on their pages for consistency and easier layout management. A common
way to achieve this is with the following CSS snippet:

```html
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
*, *::before, *::after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}
```

**Explanation:**

* `html { box-sizing: border-box; }`: Sets the base
  `box-sizing` for the root element.
* `*, *::before, *::after { box-sizing: inherit; }`: This
  rule selects all elements (`*`), as well as all
  `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements. It
  sets their `box-sizing` property to `inherit`.
  This means they will inherit the `box-sizing` value from
  their parent element. Since we set `border-box` on the
  `html` element, most elements will inherit this.

This approach is considered robust because it allows you to easily
override `box-sizing` for specific components if needed,
simply by setting it directly on that component, and its children will
inherit that specific setting rather than the global
`border-box`.

**Why not just `* { box-sizing: border-box; }`?**
While simpler, using `inherit` as shown above provides more
flexibility if you ever need to use `content-box` for a
specific section of your site and want its children to naturally
follow that, rather than being forced to `border-box` by a
global wildcard selector.

### Example: Two Columns

Consider a simple two-column layout:

Column 1 (border-box, 50% width, padding, border)

Column 2 (border-box, 50% width, padding, border)

Without `border-box`, if `width: 50%;` was set and
padding/border added, the total width would exceed 100%, causing columns
to wrap.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
  html {
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }
  *, *::before, *::after {
    box-sizing: inherit;
  }
  .row {
    display: flex; /* Simple way to create columns */
    width: 100%;
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    padding: 5px;
  }
  .column {
    width: 50%; /* Each column aims for 50% */
    padding: 15px;
    border: 3px solid #555;
    text-align: center;
  }
  .col1 { background-color: #add8e6; } /* LightBlue */
  .col2 { background-color: #90ee90; } /* LightGreen */
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="column col1">
      Column 1 <br> (50% width + padding + border still fits!)
    </div>
    <div class="column col2">
      Column 2 <br> (50% width + padding + border still fits!)
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```
