# Clearing Floats and Overflow Property

Yesterday, we learned about floating elements. A common challenge with
floats is that they are taken out of the normal document flow, which can
cause their parent container to collapse or subsequent content to wrap
undesirably. Today, we'll explore techniques to "clear" floats and also
discuss the versatile overflow property.

## The Problem: Container Collapse


When a container element only contains floated elements (or its
non-floated content is shorter than the floats), its height might not
expand to enclose the floated children. This is because floated elements
do not contribute to the height calculation of their parent in the
normal flow.

Float 1

Float 2

The red-dashed container above demonstrates this collapse if no clearing
method is applied to it (its current border is just for illustration).

## The clear Property


The `clear` property is used to control the behavior of an
element with respect to floating elements that precede it. It specifies
whether an element can be next to floating elements or if it should be
moved down (cleared) below them.

The `clear` property can take the following values:

* **none**: The element is not moved down to clear past floating elements. This
  is the default.
* **left**: The element is moved down to clear past left-floating elements.
* **right**: The element is moved down to clear past right-floating elements.
* **both**: The element is moved down to clear past both left and right
  floating elements.
* inherit: The element inherits the clear value of its
  parent.

### Method 1: Using an Empty Clearing Element

A common, older technique is to add an empty element (like a
`<div>`) after the floated elements and apply
`clear: both;` to it.

Float 2

Container now correctly wraps floats.

```css
<div class="container">
  <div style="float: left; width: 100px; height: 50px; background: lightblue;">Float A</div>
  <div style="float: left; width: 100px; height: 50px; background: lightgreen;">Float B</div>
  <div style="clear: both;"></div> <!-- Clearing element -->
</div>
<p>This paragraph will appear below the floated elements and the container.</p>
```

While this works, it adds non-semantic HTML to the markup.

### Method 2: The "Clearfix" Hack (using `::after` pseudo-element)

A more modern and preferred method is the "clearfix" technique, which
uses the `::after` pseudo-element on the container of the
floated elements.

Float 1

Float 2

Container (with .clearfix) now correctly wraps floats without extra
HTML.

```css
.clearfix::after {
  content: ""; /* Generates an empty pseudo-element */
  display: table; /* Or display: block; can also work, but table is common for older clearfix */
  clear: both; /* Clears the floats */
}
/* Apply this class to the container of floated elements */
```

```html
<div class="container clearfix">
  <div style="float: left; width: 100px; height: 50px; background: lightblue;">Float A</div>
  <div style="float: right; width: 100px; height: 50px; background: lightcoral;">Float B</div>
  <!-- No extra clearing div needed -->
</div>
<p>This content follows normally.</p>
```

### Method 3: Using `overflow` on the Container

Setting the `overflow` property on the parent container to a
value other than `visible` (e.g., `auto`,
`hidden`, or `scroll`) will cause the parent to
establish a new Block Formatting Context (BFC). A BFC will contain its
floated children, thus solving the collapse issue.

Float 1

Float 2

Container (with overflow:auto) now correctly wraps floats.

```css
.container-overflow {
  overflow: auto; /* or hidden, scroll */
  border: 1px solid blue; /* Just to see the container */
}
```

This is often the simplest method but be aware that
`overflow: hidden` will clip content that extends beyond the
container's bounds, and `overflow: scroll/auto` might show
scrollbars if content exceeds dimensions.

### Method 4: Using `display: flow-root;`

A newer CSS value, `display: flow-root;`, is specifically
designed to create a BFC without any other side effects (like clipping
or scrollbars from `overflow`).

Float 1

Float 2

Container (with display:flow-root) now correctly wraps floats.

```css
.container-flow-root {
  display: flow-root;
  border: 1px solid green; /* Just to see the container */
}
```

Browser support for `flow-root` is good in modern browsers,
but check compatibility if older browser support is needed.

## The overflow Property

The `overflow` property specifies what should happen if
content overflows an element's box (i.e., when the content is too big to
fit within the element's specified dimensions and padding).

It can take the following values:

* **visible**: The overflow is not clipped. Content renders outside the element's
  box. This is the default.
* **hidden**: The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be
  invisible. No scrollbars are shown.
* **scroll**: The overflow is clipped, but scrollbars are added to allow viewing
  the rest of the content. Scrollbars are shown regardless of whether
  content actually overflows.
* **auto**: Similar to `scroll`, but scrollbars are only added if
  content overflows. This is often preferred over `scroll` to
  avoid unnecessary scrollbars.
* **inherit**: The element inherits the overflow value of its
  parent.

There are also overflow-x and
overflow-y properties to control overflow independently for
the horizontal and vertical axes.

overflow: visible; (Default)

This is some long content that will overflow its container.

overflow: hidden;

This is some long content that will be hidden where it overflows.

overflow: scroll;

This is some long content that will cause scrollbars to appear. Even
if it fits, scrollbars are shown.

overflow: auto;

This is some long content that will cause scrollbars to appear only
if needed.

```css
.box-scroll {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  overflow: auto; /* Adds scrollbars if content inside is larger */
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
}
.box-hidden {
  width: 100px;
  height: 50px;
  overflow: hidden; /* Clips any content that doesn't fit */
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}
```

As mentioned, setting overflow to auto or
hidden on a container is a common way to make it self-clear
its floated children because it establishes a new Block Formatting
Context (BFC).
