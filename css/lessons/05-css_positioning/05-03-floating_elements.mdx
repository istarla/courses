# Floating Elements


The float property in CSS is used to take an element out of
the normal document flow and position it to the left or right of its
container. Surrounding content then flows around the floated element.
While modern layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid have reduced the
need for floats for overall page layout, they are still useful for
specific scenarios like wrapping text around images.

## The float Property

The `float` property can take one of the following values:

* **left**: The element floats to the left of its container. Text and other
  inline content flow around its right side.
* **right**: The element floats to the right of its container. Text and other
  inline content flow around its left side.
* **none**: The element does not float and is displayed where it occurs in the
  text. This is the default value.
* inherit: The element inherits the float value of its
  parent.

When an element is floated, it is taken out of the normal flow, and
block-level elements that follow it may behave as if the floated element
isn't there in terms of vertical space, leading to container collapse
issues (which we'll address tomorrow with "clearing floats").

## Example 1: Floating an Image to the Left



This paragraph demonstrates text wrapping around an image that is
floated to the left. The image is taken out of the normal flow, and
this text content flows along its right side and then underneath it,
once the floated element's height is exceeded. Lorem ipsum dolor sit

```css
.image-left {
  float: left;
  width: 100px; /* It's good practice to set a width on floated elements */
  height: auto;
  margin-right: 15px; /* Add some space between the image and text */
  margin-bottom: 5px; /* Space below the image before text wraps under */
}
.text-content {
  /* This text will wrap around .image-left */
}
```

## Example 2: Floating an Element to the Right

Float Right Box

This paragraph has a div floated to its right. The text content will
flow on the left side of the floated div. If the text is long enough,
it will continue below the floated element. This technique was
historically used for sidebars or callout boxes, but for complex
layouts, Flexbox or Grid are now preferred. Lorem ipsum dolor sit

```css
.pull-quote {
  float: right;
  width: 150px;
  padding: 10px;
  margin-left: 20px; /* Space from the main text */
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  border-left: 3px solid #ccc;
  font-style: italic;
}
```

## Example 3: Multiple Floated Elements

Multiple elements can be floated next to each other. If they are all
floated in the same direction (e.g., `float: left;`), they
will line up horizontally as space allows. If they are floated in
opposite directions, they will move to the respective edges of their
container.

      <div class="example-html">
        <div
          class="float-left"
          style="width: 80px; height: 80px; background-color: #f87171"
        >
          Box 1 (L)
        </div>
        <div
          class="float-left"
          style="width: 80px; height: 80px; background-color: #60a5fa"
        >
          Box 2 (L)
        </div>
        <div
          class="float-right"
          style="width: 80px; height: 80px; background-color: #34d399"
        >
          Box 3 (R)
        </div>
        <p
          style="
            clear: both;
            padding-top: 10px;
            text-align: center;
            font-size: 0.9em;
          "
        >
          Text after floated elements (cleared).
        </p>
      </div>
```css
.gallery-item {
  float: left;
  width: 30%; /* Example for a three-column gallery, needs margin/padding adjustments */
  margin: 1.5%;
  background-color: lightgrey;
  height: 100px;
  text-align: center;
  line-height: 100px;
}
/* NOTE: This simple gallery will likely have issues with container collapse
   and uneven heights, which 'clear' and other techniques address. */
```

## Key Behaviors and Considerations of Floats

* **Shrink-Wrapping:** If a floated element doesn't have an
  explicit width set, it will shrink to fit its content (similar to an
  inline-block element).
* **Block Formatting Context (BFC):** A floated element
  generates a new block formatting context. This means, for instance,
  that its own margins will not collapse with the margins of its
  children.
* **Container Collapse:** Perhaps the most common issue
  with floats is that the parent container of floated elements does not
  automatically adjust its height to encompass them if the parent itself
  has no other non-floated content in the normal flow that extends below
  the floats. This is because floated elements are taken out of the
  normal flow. We will learn how to "clear" floats tomorrow to solve
  this.
* **Overlapping:** Floated elements can overlap with other
  elements if there isn't enough space, or if subsequent elements are
  not cleared.
* **Impact on Layout:** Historically, floats were heavily
  used for creating multi-column layouts. However, this approach often
  required complex workarounds (like clearfix hacks) and could be
  fragile. Modern CSS offers Flexbox and Grid, which are far more robust
  and designed for layout purposes.

**Modern Usage:** While floats are less common for
primary page layout now, they remain the standard and best way to
achieve effects like text wrapping around an image or an initial drop
cap. For complex column-based layouts, prefer Flexbox or Grid.
