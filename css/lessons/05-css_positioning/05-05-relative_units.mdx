# Relative Units (em, rem, %, vw, vh)

Yesterday we discussed absolute units. Today, we shift our focus to
**relative length units**. Relative units are more flexible
as their actual value is calculated based on another length, such as the
font size of a parent element, the root element, or the size of the
viewport. They are fundamental for creating responsive and scalable
designs.

## What are Relative Length Units?

Relative length units define a length in relation to another property's
length. This dynamic nature makes them ideal for designs that need to
adapt to different screen sizes and user preferences (like custom font
sizes).

The main relative units we'll explore are:

* **em**: Relative to the font-size of the parent element (for
  font-size) or the element itself (for other properties).
* **rem**: Relative to the font-size of the root
  (`<html>`) element.
* **% (percentage)**: Relative to a value of the parent element
  (e.g., width, height, font-size).
* **vw (viewport width)**: Relative to 1% of the viewport's
  width.
* **vh (viewport height)**: Relative to 1% of the viewport's
  height.

Other relative units include `ex`, `ch`,
`vmin`, and `vmax`, which have more specific use
cases.

### 1.em

The `em` unit is relative to the `font-size` of
the element it's used on (for properties like `padding`,
`margin`, `width`, etc.) or relative to the
`font-size` of the parent element when used for the
`font-size` property itself.

**Characteristics:**

* If `font-size: 1.2em;` is set on an element, its font size
  will be 1.2 times the font size of its parent.
* If `padding: 2em;` is set, the padding will be 2 times the
  font size of the element itself.
* **Compounding Effect:** When `em` is used for
  `font-size` on nested elements, it can lead to a
  compounding effect, which can be powerful but also tricky to manage.
  For example, if a parent has `font-size: 1.2em` and its
  child also has `font-size: 1.2em`, the child's font size
  will be 1.2 \* 1.2 = 1.44 times the grandparent's font size.

Parent (font-size: 20px). This text is 1.2em (24px). Padding is 0.5em
(12px).

Inner child. Font-size is 1.2em of its parent (28.8px). Padding 0.5em
(14.4px).

```css
.parent {
  font-size: 16px;
}
.child {
  font-size: 1.5em; /* 1.5 * 16px = 24px */
  padding: 1em;     /* Padding will be 1 * 24px = 24px */
  margin-bottom: 0.5em; /* Margin will be 0.5 * 24px = 12px */
}
.grandchild {
  font-size: 1.5em; /* 1.5 * 24px = 36px (compounding) */
}
```

### 2. rem (Root em)

The `rem` unit is relative to the `font-size` of
the root element (`<html>`). This avoids the
compounding issue of `em` units when setting font sizes on
nested elements.

**Characteristics:**

* `1rem` is equal to the font size of the
  `<html>` element (browsers typically default this to
  `16px`, but users can change it).
* If `<html> { font-size: 10px; }`, then
  `2rem` would be `20px` anywhere in the document.
* Excellent for creating scalable layouts where typography and spacing
  can be adjusted by changing the root font size.

Parent. This text is 1.6rem (16px, based on
`html {font-size:10px;}` in example style). Padding is 1rem
(10px).

Inner child. Font-size is 1.2rem (12px). Not compounded by parent's
rem. Padding 0.5rem (5px).

```css
html {
  font-size: 62.5%; /* Common trick: 62.5% of 16px (default) = 10px. Makes 1rem = 10px for easier math. */
}
body {
  font-size: 1.6rem; /* Equivalent to 16px */
}
h1 {
  font-size: 3.2rem; /* Equivalent to 32px */
  margin-bottom: 1rem; /* Equivalent to 10px */
}
.component {
  padding: 1.5rem; /* Equivalent to 15px */
}
```

The example above uses `html { font-size: 10px; }` for
simpler demonstration. In real projects, setting
`html { font-size: 62.5%; }` is a common technique to make
`1rem = 10px` (assuming the browser default is 16px), which
simplifies calculations. However, some prefer to leave the root font
size at the browser default (or set it to `100%`) and work
with `rem` values based on that (e.g.,
`1.5rem` for `24px` if root is `16px`).

### 3. Percentage (`%`)

The percentage unit is always relative to another value. The context
depends on the property it's used for:

* For `font-size`: Relative to the font-size of the parent
  element.
* For `width`, `height`, `padding`,
  `margin` (horizontal): Relative to the
  **width** of the containing block.
* For `line-height`: Relative to the element's own font size.
* For `top`, `bottom`: Relative to the
  **height** of the containing block (if positioned).

      <div class="unit-example percentage-width-parent">
        Parent (width: 400px)
        <div class="percentage-width-child">
          Child (width: 50% of parent = 200px)
        </div>
      </div>

```css
.parent-container {
  width: 500px;
  font-size: 18px;
}
.child-element {
  width: 80%; /* 80% of 500px = 400px */
  padding: 5%; /* 5% of 500px (parent width) = 25px for left/right padding */
  font-size: 120%; /* 120% of 18px = 21.6px */
  line-height: 150%; /* 150% of its own font-size (21.6px) */
}
```

### 4. Viewport Units: vw and vh

Viewport units are relative to the size of the viewport (the browser
window's visible area).

* **`vw` (viewport width)**: 1vw = 1% of the
  viewport width.
* **`vh` (viewport height)**: 1vh = 1% of the
  viewport height.

**Characteristics:**

* Excellent for creating elements that scale directly with the browser
  window size.
* Often used for full-height hero sections (`height: 100vh;`)
  or full-width elements.
* Can also be used for font sizes (`font-size: 2vw;`) to make
  text responsive to viewport width, but this can lead to very small or
  very large text on extreme screen sizes, so use with caution (`clamp()`
  function can help here).

      <div class="unit-example vw-example">
        This box is 50vw wide and 10vh tall. (Resize your browser window to see
        it change)
      </div>
      <div class="unit-example vh-example">
        This box is 20vw wide and 30vh tall.
      </div>

```css
.full-screen-hero {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
  background-color: lightskyblue;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
.responsive-title {
  font-size: 5vw; /* Font size scales with viewport width */
  color: white;
}
.sidebar {
  width: 25vw; /* Sidebar takes 25% of viewport width */
  min-width: 200px; /* Good to combine with min/max for usability */
  height: 100vh; /* Full viewport height */
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
```

Other viewport units include `vmin` (1% of the smaller of vw
or vh) and `vmax` (1% of the larger of vw or vh).
