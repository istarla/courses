# Absolute Units (px, pt, cm, mm, in)

Welcome to Week 5! This week, we'll explore various units and values
used in CSS. We'll start today by focusing on
**absolute length units**. Absolute units are fixed and do
not change based on any other element or viewport size. They represent a
physical measurement when the output medium's properties are known (like
for print).

## What are Absolute Length Units?


Absolute length units are considered to be always the same size
regardless of the context. While this is true for physical media like
print, on screens, their actual size can depend on screen resolution
(DPI - dots per inch) and other factors. However, they are generally
more predictable in size than relative units.

The primary absolute units we'll cover are:

* `px` (pixels)
* `pt` (points)
* `cm` (centimeters)
* `mm` (millimeters)
* `in` (inches)

There are also `pc` (picas: 1pc = 12pt) and
`Q` (quarter-millimeters: 1Q = 0.25mm), but they are less
commonly used in web design.

### 1. Pixels (px)


Pixels are the most commonly used absolute unit in web design for screen
media. One pixel (`1px`) is typically defined as 1/96th of an
inch (`1in`), but this can vary based on screen density. For
low-DPI devices, `1px` is one device pixel (dot) on the
display. For high-DPI ("Retina") devices, `1px` might
correspond to multiple device pixels to maintain a consistent perceived
size.

**Characteristics:**

* Represents a single dot on a screen (historically, now more complex
  with high-DPI screens).
* Very common for defining font sizes, borders, widths, heights,
  margins, padding, etc.
* Can lead to less accessible designs if used for font sizes, as users
  might have difficulty resizing text set in pixels (though modern
  browsers handle this better). Relative units like `em` or
  `rem` are often preferred for font sizes for better
  accessibility.

This box is 200px wide. Text size is 16px.

```css
.element {
  font-size: 16px;
  width: 300px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}
```

### 2. Points (pt)

Points are traditionally used in print media. One point
(`1pt`) is equal to 1/72nd of an inch (`1in`).

**Characteristics:**

* Primarily intended for print stylesheets.
* Less common for screen styling because pixel density varies more on
  screens than on paper.
* Generally, `16px` is roughly equivalent to
  `12pt` on a typical screen with 96 DPI.

This text is 12pt.

```css
@media print {
  body {
    font-size: 12pt; /* Common for print documents */
    line-height: 1.5; /* Using a unitless number is still good for line-height */
  }
  .heading-print {
    font-size: 18pt;
    margin-bottom: 6pt;
  }
}
/* For screen, this might not be ideal */
.screen-text {
  font-size: 10pt; /* This will translate to a px value by the browser */
}
```

### 3. Centimeters (cm), Millimeters (mm), Inches (in)

These are physical units of length, directly corresponding to their
real-world measurements.

* `1in = 2.54cm = 25.4mm`
* `1in = 96px` (CSS "reference pixel" definition)
* `1in = 72pt`

**Characteristics:**

* Most useful when the physical properties of the output medium are
  known, primarily for print stylesheets.
* Can be used for screen styling, but their actual rendered size on
  screen depends on the screen's DPI. A `1cm` line on a
  low-DPI monitor might look different from `1cm` on a
  high-DPI phone screen or a projector.
* Generally not recommended for responsive web design where elements
  need to adapt to various screen sizes.

Width: 5cm, Height: 2cm

Width: 50mm, Height: 10mm (Same as 5cm x 1cm)

Width: 2in, Height: 0.5in

```css
.page-for-print {
  width: 21cm; /* A4 paper width */
  height: 29.7cm; /* A4 paper height */
  padding: 1in; /* 1 inch padding around */
}

.ruler-marking {
  height: 5mm;
  width: 1px; /* Even px can be used with physical units */
  background-color: black;
  margin-bottom: 0.25cm;
}
```

## When to Use Absolute Units

* **Print Stylesheets:** Units like `cm`,
  `mm`, `in`, and `pt` are ideal for
  print because the output medium has fixed physical dimensions.
* **Fixed-Size Elements (with caution):** Pixels
  (`px`) can be used for elements that need to maintain a
  specific size, like logos, icons, or sometimes borders and fixed-width
  containers. However, for overall page layout and typography, relative
  units often provide better flexibility and accessibility.
* **When Pixel-Perfection is Required (Screen):** If a
  design needs to align precisely with a pixel grid for screen display,
  `px` is the go-to.

## Limitations and Considerations

* **Accessibility:** Using absolute units (especially
  `px`) for font sizes can sometimes make it harder for users
  to scale text according to their preferences, although modern browsers
  have improved zoom functionalities. Relative units (`em`,
  `rem`, `%`) are generally favored for font
  sizes.
* **Responsiveness:** Absolute units do not adapt to
  different screen sizes or viewport dimensions. For responsive web
  design, relative units (like `%`, `vw`,
  `vh`, `em`, `rem`) are essential.
* **Screen vs. Print:** The perceived size of physical
  units like `cm` or `in` on a screen can be
  inconsistent due to varying screen DPIs. Their use is more reliable
  for print.

While `px` is an absolute unit, it's become the de facto
standard for many screen-based designs. Modern CSS often involves a
mix: `px` for things like border widths or specific icon
sizes, and relative units (which we'll cover next) for typography and
layout containers to ensure responsiveness and scalability.
