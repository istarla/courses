# Viewport Meta Tag

Yesterday, we introduced Responsive Web Design (RWD). A critical
component required for RWD to function correctly on mobile devices is
the **viewport meta tag**. Today, we'll explore what the
viewport is, why this tag is essential, and the different directives you
can use within it.

## What is the Viewport?

The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies
depending on the device:

* On desktop computers, the viewport is the browser window. Resizing the
  window changes the viewport size.
* On mobile devices, the viewport is typically the screen area available
  to the browser, but mobile browsers handle it differently by default
  without the viewport meta tag.

## The Problem Without the Viewport Meta Tag


Mobile browsers, when first encountering a web page not optimized for
mobile, often assume it's a desktop site. To display it, they use a
"virtual" viewport much wider than the physical screen (e.g., 980px
wide) and then shrink the rendered result down to fit the physical
screen. This results in:

* Text becoming tiny and unreadable.
* Users having to zoom in and pan around to navigate the content.
* Media queries based on device width not triggering correctly, as the
  browser reports the wider virtual viewport width.

This behavior was a reasonable default when most websites weren't
mobile-friendly, but it prevents responsive designs from working as
intended.

## The Solution:
```css  
<meta name="viewport">
```

The viewport meta tag, placed within the `<head>` of
your HTML, allows you to control the browser's viewport size and
scaling.

The standard, recommended viewport tag for RWD is:

```css
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

Let's break down the `content` attribute directives:

* **`width=device-width`**: This is the crucial part. It tells the browser to set the width of
  the viewport equal to the width of the device's screen (in
  device-independent pixels) instead of using the default virtual
  viewport width. This ensures that media queries based on width
  function correctly.
* **`initial-scale=1.0`**: This sets the initial zoom level when the page first loads. A value
  of `1.0` prevents the browser from initially zooming in or
  out, displaying the page at its intended size (1 CSS pixel = 1
  device-independent pixel).

## Visual Comparison (Conceptual)

**Without Viewport Tag on Mobile:**  
Browser uses wide virtual viewport (e.g., 980px), renders page, then
scales down to fit screen. Text is tiny. Media queries might not
activate correctly.

**With width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0:**  
Browser sets viewport width to device width. Page renders at 1:1
scale. Text is readable. Responsive styles based on device width apply
correctly.

(Note: The iframes above are illustrative; actual mobile browser
rendering depends on the device.)

## Other Viewport Directives

While `width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0` is standard,
other directives exist, though some should be used with caution:

* **`height=device-height`**: Sets the viewport height to the device height. Less commonly used
  than `width`.
* **`minimum-scale=<value>`**: Sets the minimum allowed zoom level (e.g.,
  `minimum-scale=1.0`).
* **`maximum-scale=<value>`**: Sets the maximum allowed zoom level (e.g.,
  `maximum-scale=3.0`).
* **`user-scalable=yes/no`**: Controls whether the user is allowed to zoom in or out. Setting
  this to `no` (or setting `maximum-scale=1.0`) is
  **strongly discouraged** as it hinders accessibility for
  users with low vision.

```css
<!-- Example allowing more zoom -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=5.0, minimum-scale=0.5">

<!-- ****** AVOID THIS - Bad for Accessibility ****** -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0">
```

**Accessibility First:** Always allow users to zoom.
Disabling zoom (`user-scalable=no` or
`maximum-scale=1.0`) prevents users with visual impairments
from enlarging content, violating WCAG (Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines). Stick to
`width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0` unless you have a
very specific, well-justified reason to modify scaling, and even then,
avoid disabling user scaling.

## Where to Place It

The viewport meta tag should be placed within the
`<head>` section of your HTML document, usually early
on, before any large CSS or JavaScript files are loaded, to ensure the
browser applies the settings as soon as possible.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Responsive Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Page content -->
</body>
</html>
```
