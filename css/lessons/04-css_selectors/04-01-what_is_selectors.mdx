### Basic CSS Selectors


Selectors are patterns that select the HTML elements you want to style.
Here are some of the most basic and commonly used selectors:

## **1. Element Selector (or Type Selector)**


This selector targets all HTML elements of a specific type.

**Example:** Selects all `<h2>` elements.

```css
h2 {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
}
```

This rule would apply the Arial font (or a generic sans-serif font if
Arial is not available) and center-align the text for all
`<h2>` headings on the page.

## **2. Class Selector**


The class selector targets HTML elements that have a specific
`class` attribute. To select elements with a specific class,
write a period (`.`) character, followed by the class name.

**HTML Example:**

```html
<p class="highlight">This paragraph will be highlighted.</p>
<div class="highlight">This div will also be highlighted.</div>
<p>This paragraph will not.</p>
```

**CSS Example:** Selects all elements with
`class="highlight"`.

```css
.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

An element can have multiple classes, separated by spaces (e.g.,
`class="highlight important"`). You can target elements with
multiple specific classes by chaining them without spaces (e.g.,
`.highlight.important`).

## **3. ID Selector**


The ID selector targets a single HTML element that has a specific
`id` attribute. IDs must be unique within an HTML document.
To select an element with a specific ID, write a hash (`#`)
character, followed by the ID of the element.

**HTML Example:**

```html
<div id="main-header">This is the main header.</div>
```

**CSS Example:** Selects the element with
`id="main-header"`.

```css
main-header {
  padding: 20px;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;
}
```

While powerful, ID selectors have high specificity and should be used
sparingly, often for unique page landmarks or JavaScript hooks, rather
than general styling.

## **4. Universal Selector**



The universal selector (`*`) selects all HTML elements on the
page. It's often used to apply global resets or default styles, but
should be used with caution as it can have performance implications and
override desired styles if not handled carefully.

**CSS Example:** Applies a red border to every element (not
generally recommended for this purpose, but illustrates the selector).

```css
* {
  /* A common use case is for box-sizing reset: */
  /* box-sizing: border-box; */
  /* Example for illustration: */
  border: 1px dotted red; /* Not practical for all elements */
}
```

A more practical use is setting a default box-sizing for all elements:

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

## **5. Grouping Selector**


You can apply the same styles to multiple selectors by grouping them
with commas. This helps to reduce code duplication.

**CSS Example:** Applies the same styles to
`<h1>`, `<h2>`, and
`<p>` elements.

```css
h1, h2, p {
  color: navy;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
```
