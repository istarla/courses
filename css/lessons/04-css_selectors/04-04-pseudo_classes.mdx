# Pseudo-classes

Pseudo-classes are keywords added to selectors that specify a special
state of the selected element(s). They allow you to style elements based
on user interaction, their position in the document tree, or other
conditions not reflected by a simple attribute or element type.
Pseudo-classes start with a colon (`:`).

## 1. Link and User Action Pseudo-classes

These pseudo-classes react to how the user interacts with elements,
especially links and form controls.

* **:link**: Selects unvisited links.
* **:visited**: Selects visited links. (Note: For privacy reasons, the styles you
  can apply to `:visited` links are limited, primarily to
  color.)
* **:hover**: Selects an element when the user mouses over it.
* **:active**: Selects an element when it is being activated (e.g., clicked on a
  link or button).
* **:focus**: Selects an element when it has keyboard focus (e.g., tabbing to an
  input field or link).
* **:focus-within**: Selects an element if it or any of its descendants has focus.
* **:focus-visible**: Selects an element when it has focus and the browser determines via
  heuristics that the focus should be made visible (e.g. keyboard
  navigation).

[Example Link (Unvisited)](#exampleLink1)  
[Google (Potentially Visited)](https://www.google.com)

```css
a:link { color: blue; }
a:visited { color: purple; }
a:hover { color: red; text-decoration: underline; }
button:active { background-color: yellow; }
input:focus { border-color: orange; box-shadow: 0 0 3px orange; }
div:focus-within { background-color: lightgrey; }
```

**Order Matters (LVHA):** For link pseudo-classes, it's
generally recommended to define them in the order: `:link`,
`:visited`, `:hover`,
`:active` (Mnemonic: LoVe HAte) to ensure they work as
expected due to CSS specificity rules.

## 2. Structural Pseudo-classes


These pseudo-classes select elements based on their position and
relationship within the document structure.
1. **:root**: Selects the root element of the document (usually
  `<html>`). Often used for CSS Custom Properties
  (variables).
2. **:first-child**: Selects an element that is the first child of its parent.
3. **:last-child**: Selects an element that is the last child of its parent.
4. **:nth-child(n)**: Selects elements based on their position among siblings.
  `n` can be a number (`1`, `2`, etc.),
  a keyword (`odd`, `even`), or a formula
  (`2n+1`, `3n`, `-n+5`). Indexing is
  1-based.
5. **:nth-last-child(n)**: Same as `:nth-child(n)`, but counts from the last child.
6. **:first-of-type**: Selects the first sibling of its type.
7. **:last-of-type**: Selects the last sibling of its type.
8. **:nth-of-type(n)**: Selects siblings of a certain type based on their order among
  siblings of the same type.
9. **:nth-last-of-type(n)**: Same as `:nth-of-type(n)`, but counts from the last
  sibling of that type.
10. **:only-child**: Selects an element that is the only child of its parent.
11. **:only-of-type**: Selects an element that is the only sibling of its type.
12. **:empty**: Selects elements that have no children (including text nodes).
  Comments or whitespace may count as content.

* Item 1 (First child)
* Item 2
* Item 3 (Last child)

1. Alpha (Odd)
2. Beta (Even)
3. Gamma (Odd)
4. Delta (Even)

First paragraph.

Second paragraph of type P.

Div element

Third paragraph of type P.

```css
:root { --main-color: #333; }
ul li:first-child { font-weight: bold; }
ul li:last-child { font-style: italic; }
ol li:nth-child(even) { background-color: #f0f0f0; }
article p:nth-of-type(2) { color: green; } /* Second

in

*/
div:empty { border: 1px solid red; min-height: 10px; }
```

## 3. Form and Input Pseudo-classes

These target form elements based on their state or attributes.

* **`:checked`**: Selects radio buttons, checkboxes, or options in a
  `<select>` that are currently selected/checked.
* **`:disabled`**: Selects UI elements (like `<input>`,
  `<button>`) that are in a disabled state.
* **`:enabled`**: Selects UI elements that are in an enabled state.
* **`:required`**: Selects form elements that have the
  `required` attribute.
* **`:optional`**: Selects form elements that do not have the
  `required` attribute.
* **`:read-only`**: Selects elements that have the `readonly` attribute.
* **`:read-write`**: Selects elements that are user-editable (e.g., inputs without
  `readonly`, `contenteditable` elements).
* **`:in-range`** /
  **`:out-of-range`**: For input types with range constraints (e.g.,
  `type="number"` with `min` and
  `max` attributes).
* **`:valid`** /
  **`:invalid`**: For input elements based on their form validation status.

Opt-in

```css
input[type="checkbox"]:checked + label {
  color: green;
  font-weight: bold;
}
input:disabled {
  background-color: #eee;
  cursor: not-allowed;
}
input:required:invalid { /* Style invalid required fields */
  border-left: 3px solid red;
}
```

## 4. Negation Pseudo-class: `:not()`


The `:not(X)` pseudo-class takes a simple selector (or a list
of simple selectors in Selectors Level 4) as an argument. It matches
elements that are *not* represented by the argument.

**Example:** `p:not(.special)` selects all
`<p>` elements that do not have the class
`special`.

A regular paragraph.

A special paragraph.

Another regular paragraph.

```css
p:not(.highlight) {
  color: #555; /* Dim non-highlighted paragraphs */
}

/* Select all inputs that are not disabled */
input:not(:disabled) {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}
```
