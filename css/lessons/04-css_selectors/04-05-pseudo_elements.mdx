# Pseudo-elements

Pseudo-elements are keywords added to a selector that let you style a
specific part of the selected element(s). For example, you can style the
first letter or line of an element, or insert content before or after
the content of an element. Pseudo-elements use a double colon
(`::`) syntax (e.g., `::before`), although
browsers also support the single colon syntax (`:before`) for
backward compatibility with older pseudo-elements from CSS1 and CSS2.

**`:` vs `::`:** The CSS3
specification recommends using `::` for pseudo-elements to
distinguish them from pseudo-classes (which use a single
`:`). For older pseudo-elements like `:before`,
`:after`, `:first-line`, and
`:first-letter`, the single-colon syntax is still widely
supported. However, for newer pseudo-elements like
`::marker` or `::placeholder`, the double-colon
syntax is required. It's generally good practice to use
`::` for all pseudo-elements.

## 1. ::first-line

The `::first-line` pseudo-element applies styles to the first
line of a block-level element. The length of the first line depends on
many factors, including the width of the element, the width of the
document, and the font size of the text.

This is a paragraph of text. The first line of this paragraph will be
styled differently than the rest of the text. This effect dynamically
adjusts if the width of the container changes, causing the line breaks
to shift.

```css
p::first-line {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: navy;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
```

## 2. ::first-letter

The `::first-letter` pseudo-element applies styles to the
first letter of the first line of a block-level element, but only if
it's not preceded by other content (such as images or inline tables) on
its line.

Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a web developer
who loved CSS. They used pseudo-elements to create beautiful and
engaging web pages.

```css
article p::first-letter {
  font-size: 3em; /* Make the first letter much larger */
  color: #8B0000; /* DarkRed */
  float: left; /* Allows text to wrap around it */
  margin-right: 0.1em;
  line-height: 0.8; /* Adjust line height for better alignment */
}
```

## 3. ::before and ::after

The `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements
create a pseudo-element that is the first child (for
`::before`) or last child (for `::after`) of the
selected element. They are often used to add cosmetic content to an
element, such as an icon or a text string, using the
`content` property. The `content` property is
required for these pseudo-elements to be rendered.

These pseudo-elements are inline by default.

This is an important piece of information.

```css
.warning::before {
  content: "⚠️ "; /* Adds a warning emoji before */
}

q::before {
  content: open-quote; /* Inserts the appropriate opening quotation mark */
}
q::after {
  content: close-quote; /* Inserts the appropriate closing quotation mark */
}

a.pdf-link::after {
  content: " (PDF)";
  font-size: 0.8em;
  color: gray;
}
```

Content inserted with `::before` and
`::after` is generally not accessible to screen readers by
default unless specific ARIA attributes are used, or if the content is
purely decorative. Be mindful of accessibility when using them for
crucial information.

## 4. ::marker


The `::marker` pseudo-element selects the marker box of a
list item (`<li>`), which typically contains a bullet
or number. It can be used to style the color, size, content (using
`content` property), and other properties of the list marker.

* First item with a styled marker.
* Second item.

1. Numbered item one.
2. Numbered item two.

```css
ul li::marker {
  color: green;
  font-size: 1.2em;
  /* content: "► "; You can change the marker symbol */
}

ol li::marker {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: purple;
}
```

## 5. ::selection

The `::selection` pseudo-element applies styles to the
portion of a document that has been highlighted by the user (e.g., by
clicking and dragging the mouse across text).

Only a limited set of CSS properties can be used with
`::selection`: `color`,
`background-color`, `cursor`,
`caret-color`, `outline`,
`text-decoration`, `text-emphasis-color`, and
`text-shadow`.

Try selecting this text to see the custom selection style. It should
have a yellow background and dark text when selected.

```css
::selection {
  background-color: #ffcc00; /* Bright yellow background */
  color: #333333; /* Dark text */
}

/* Firefox uses a separate pseudo-element */
::-moz-selection {
  background-color: #ffcc00;
  color: #333333;
}
```

## 6. ::placeholder


The `::placeholder` pseudo-element styles the placeholder
text in an input or textarea field. Placeholder text is usually
displayed when the field is empty and loses focus.

```css
input::placeholder {
  color: #9ca3af; /* gray-400 */
  font-style: italic;
  opacity: 0.8; /* Some browsers might need opacity for consistency */
}

/* For cross-browser compatibility, you might need vendor prefixes: */
input::-webkit-input-placeholder { /* Chrome, Safari, Opera, Edge */
  color: #9ca3af;
  font-style: italic;
}
input::-moz-placeholder { /* Firefox 19+ */
  color: #9ca3af;
  font-style: italic;
  opacity: 1; /* Firefox applies a lower opacity by default */
}
input:-ms-input-placeholder { /* Internet Explorer 10-11 */
  color: #9ca3af;
  font-style: italic;
}
input::-ms-input-placeholder { /* Microsoft Edge (legacy) */
  color: #9ca3af;
  font-style: italic;
}
```
