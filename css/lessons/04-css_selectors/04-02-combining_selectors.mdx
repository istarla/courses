# Combining Selectors

Welcome to Week 3! We've learned about basic selectors like element,
class, and ID selectors. Today, we'll explore how to combine these basic
selectors to target HTML elements with greater precision using
combinators. Combinators allow you to define relationships between
selectors.

The following HTML structure will be used for examples:

```html
<div class="container">
  <h2>Main Title</h2>
  <p>A paragraph directly inside container.</p>
  <div class="section highlight-descendant highlight-child">
    <p>Paragraph inside section (child of section, descendant of container).</p>
    <span>A span here.</span>
    <p>Another paragraph inside section.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="highlight-adjacent highlight-general">Paragraph after section (sibling).</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li class="special"><a href="#">Special Item Link</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Last paragraph in container.</p>
</div>
```

## 1. Descendant Combinator (space)

The descendant combinator, represented by a space, selects elements that
are descendants of a specified element. A descendant can be a child,
grandchild, great-grandchild, and so on, at any level deep within the
specified ancestor.

**Syntax:** `ancestor descendant`

**Example:** `.container p` selects all
`<p>` elements that are anywhere inside an element with
the class `container`.

## Main Title

A paragraph directly inside container. (This will be blue)

Paragraph inside section. (This will also be blue)

A span here.

Another paragraph inside section. (This will also be blue)

Paragraph after section (sibling). (This will be blue)

Last paragraph in container. (This will be blue)

```css
/* Selects all <p> elements that are descendants of an element with class "container" */
.container p {
  color: blue;
}

/* Selects <a> tags only if they are inside an <li> with class "special" */
li.special a {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: green;
}
```

## 2. Child Combinator (`>`)

The child combinator, represented by the greater-than sign
(`>`), selects elements that are direct children of a
specified element. It does not select deeper descendants (grandchildren,
etc.).

**Syntax:** `parent > child`

**Example:** `.section > p` selects only
```css
`<p>` elements that are direct children of an element
with the class `section`.
```
## Main Title (not a direct child paragraph)

A paragraph directly inside container (not child of .section).

Paragraph inside section. (This will be bold)

A span here.

Another paragraph inside section. (This will be bold)

Grandchild paragraph (not a direct child of .section). (This will
NOT be bold)

```css
/* Selects <p> elements that are direct children of elements with class "section" */
.section > p {
  font-weight: bold;
  border-left: 3px solid red;
  padding-left: 5px;
}

/* Selects <li> elements that are direct children of a <ul> element */
ul > li {
  list-style-type: square;
}
```

## 3. Adjacent Sibling Combinator (`+`)

The adjacent sibling combinator, represented by a plus sign
(`+`), selects an element that is the immediately following
sibling of a specified element. Both elements must share the same
parent, and the second element must come directly after the first in the
HTML markup.

**Syntax:** `first_element + second_element`
```css
**Example:** `h2 + p` selects a
`<p>` element only if it immediately follows an
`<h2>` element (and they are siblings).
```
## Main Title

A paragraph directly after h2. (This will be italic)

Another paragraph, not immediately after h2. (This will NOT be italic)

I'm a div

Paragraph after section div. (This will be italic, if the div was h2,
or if the rule was .section + p)

```css
/* Selects a <p> element that immediately follows an <h2> element */
h2 + p {
  font-style: italic;
  color: #555;
}

/* Selects a <ul> that immediately follows an element with class "intro" */
.intro + ul {
  margin-top: 0; /* Remove top margin if it follows an intro */
}
```

## 4. General Sibling Combinator (`~`)

The general sibling combinator, represented by a tilde (`~`),
selects elements that are siblings of a specified element and come after
it in the HTML markup. They don't have to be immediately adjacent, but
they must share the same parent.

**Syntax:** `first_element ~ sibling_element`
```css
**Example:** `h2 ~ p` selects all
`<p>` elements that are siblings of an
`<h2>` element and appear after it.
```
## Main Title

A paragraph after h2. (This will be underlined)

A div sibling

Another paragraph sibling after h2 and div. (This will be underlined)

Yet another paragraph sibling. (This will be underlined)

```css
/* Selects all <p> elements that are siblings of and come after an <h2> element */
h2 ~ p {
  text-decoration: underline;
  color: purple;
}

/* Selects all <li> elements that are siblings of an <li> with class "active" and come after it */
li.active ~ li {
  opacity: 0.7;
}
```

**Combining Combinators:** You can chain multiple
combinators and selectors together to create very specific targeting
rules. For example:
`div.main-content > article h3 + p` would select a
paragraph that immediately follows an `h3`, where that
`h3` is a descendant of an `article` element,
which itself is a direct child of a `div` with the class
`main-content`.
