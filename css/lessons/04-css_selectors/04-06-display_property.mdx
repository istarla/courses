# The Display Property

Welcome to Week 4! We're starting this week with a fundamental CSS
property that dictates how an element is rendered in the document
layout: the `display` property. It controls the element's
inner and outer display types, influencing its behavior in terms of
flow, sizing, and interaction with other elements.

## Understanding Display Types

Every HTML element has a default display value. However, the
`display` property allows you to change this. The most common
values are `block`, `inline`,
`inline-block`, and `none`. Modern CSS also
introduces layout-specific values like `flex` and
`grid`, which we'll cover in detail in future lessons.

### 1. display: block

Block-level elements typically start on a new line and take up the full
width available to them (stretching out to the left and right as far as
they can within their container).

**Characteristics:**

* Always starts on a new line.
* Takes up the full available width of its parent container by default.
* You can set explicit `width` and
  `height` properties.
* `padding`, `margin`, and
  `border` will push other elements away. Vertical margins
  (top and bottom) are respected between block elements.
* Common block-level elements include: `<div>`,
  `<p>`,
  `<h1>`-`<h6>`,
  `<ul>`, `<ol>`,
  `<li>`, `<form>`,
  `<article>`, `<section>`.

I am a block element (`div`).

I am another block element. I start on a new line.

I am a span, but styled as block (width 50%).

```css
div {
  display: block; /* Default for div */
  background-color: lightblue;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  padding: 15px;
}
span.make-block {
  display: block;
  width: 200px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: lightcoral;
}
```

### 2. display: inline


Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much
width as necessary for their content. They flow along with the text
content.

**Characteristics:**

* Does not start on a new line; flows with surrounding content.
* Only takes up as much width as its content requires.
* You **cannot** set explicit `width` and
  `height` properties for them. These properties will be
  ignored.
* Horizontal `padding`, `margin`, and
  `border` will apply and push other inline elements
  horizontally.
* Vertical `padding`, `margin` (top/bottom), and
  `border` apply, but they generally
  **do not** affect the layout of surrounding block-level
  elements or other inline elements in terms of vertical spacing.
  Top/bottom margins have no effect.
* Common inline elements include: `<span>`,
  `<a>`, `<img>` (though
  `<img>` is a bit special, it's a "replaced element"),
  `<strong>`, `<em>`,
  `<button>` (often styled as inline-block by user
  agents).

This paragraph contains
an inline span and also
[an inline link](#). They flow
together.
This span has width/height set, but they are ignored. Vertical
padding/margin won't push block elements.

```css
span {
  display: inline; /* Default for span */
  background-color: yellow;
  padding: 5px;
  margin: 0 3px; /* Horizontal margin works */
  /* width: 100px;  This would be ignored */
  /* height: 30px; This would be ignored */
}
div.make-inline {
  display: inline; /* Change a div to behave like an inline element */
  background-color: lightpink;
}
```

### 3. display: inline-block


Inline-block elements are a hybrid. They flow with surrounding content
like inline elements, but you can set `width` and
`height` on them, and they respect vertical margins and
padding, like block elements.

**Characteristics:**

* Flows with surrounding content (does not start on a new line unless
  there's no space).
* You **can** set explicit `width` and
  `height` properties.
* `padding`, `margin` (including vertical), and
  `border` are all respected and affect layout.
* Often used for navigation items, buttons, or small layout components
  that need specific dimensions but should remain in the flow of text.

Here are some inline-block elements:
Box 1
Box 2 (taller)
A Button
They sit on the same line but can have custom dimensions and full
margin/padding.

```css
button.custom-style {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 120px;
  height: 40px;
  line-height: 40px; /* To vertically center text */
  background-color: lightseagreen;
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
  margin: 5px;
  padding: 0 10px;
}
nav a {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 10px 15px;
  background-color: #333;
  color: white;
  text-decoration: none;
  margin-right: 5px;
}
```

### 4. display: none


When an element has `display: none;`, it is completely
removed from the document layout. It takes up no space, and it's as if
it doesn't exist on the page. Its descendants are also not rendered.

This is different from `visibility: hidden;`, where the
element is hidden but still occupies its space in the layout.

This box is visible.

This box has `display: none;` and will NOT be visible or
take up space.

This box appears right after the first one.

```css
.hidden-element {
  display: none;
}
/* Often used with JavaScript to show/hide elements:
   document.getElementById('myElement').style.display = 'none';
   document.getElementById('myElement').style.display = 'block'; // Or 'inline', etc.
*/

/* Example: Hiding elements for specific screen sizes (though media queries are better for this) */
.mobile-only { display: block; }
.desktop-only { display: none; }
/* In a media query for desktop:
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .mobile-only { display: none; }
  .desktop-only { display: block; }
}
*/
```

**Accessibility Note:** Elements with
`display: none;` are typically not perceived by assistive
technologies (like screen readers). If you need to hide content visually
but keep it accessible, other techniques (like positioning it
off-screen) are preferred.

## Other display Values


CSS has many other values for the `display` property,
designed for specific layout models:

* **flex**: Enables Flexbox layout for an element's direct children. We'll
  cover this in Week 6.
* **grid**: Enables CSS Grid layout for an element's direct children. We'll
  cover this in Week 7.
* **table`, `table-row`, `table-cell:**
  Allow elements to behave like HTML table elements.
* **list-item**: Makes an element behave like an
  `<li>` element, typically generating a marker box.
* **contents**: The element itself generates no boxes, but its
  children and pseudo-elements still do. It's as if the element is
  "unwrapped". Use with caution, can affect accessibility.
* **flow-root**: Creates a new block formatting context (BFC),
  which can be useful for containing floats, among other things.
