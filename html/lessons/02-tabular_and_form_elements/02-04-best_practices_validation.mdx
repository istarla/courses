# HTML Best Practices & Validation

## Why Best Practices Matter
<section id="why-best-practices-matter" />

Writing HTML correctly isn't just about making things appear on the
screen. Following best practices ensures your web pages are:

* **Accessible:** Usable by everyone, including people with
  disabilities using assistive technologies (like screen readers).
* **Maintainable:** Easier for you and other developers to
  read, understand, and update in the future.
* **Performant:** Can contribute to faster loading times
  and better browser rendering.
* **SEO-Friendly:** Easier for search engines to crawl and
  understand your content.
* **Cross-Browser Compatible:** More likely to render
  consistently across different web browsers.

## Key HTML Best Practices
<section id="key-html-best-practices" />

* ### Use Semantic HTML Appropriately
  <br/>
  As covered before, use elements like `<header>`,
  `<nav>`, `<main>`,
  `<article>`, `<section>`,
  `<aside>`, and `<footer>` to
  structure your content meaningfully. Avoid "div-itis" (using
  `<div>` for everything when a more specific semantic
  tag exists). Use `<h1>`-`<h6>`
  hierarchically.


* ### Always Include `alt` Text for Images
  <br/>
  Provide meaningful alternative text for all images using the
  `alt`
  attribute. This is critical for accessibility and SEO. For purely
  decorative images, use an empty alt attribute (`alt=""`) so
  screen readers can skip them.
  <br/>
  *Sample Code*
  ```html
  <img src="logo.png" alt="ACME Corp Logo">
  <img src="decorative-swirl.png" alt="">
  <img src="important-diagram.png" alt="">
  <img src="photo.jpg" alt="image">
  ```

* ### Use Labels Correctly with Form Inputs
  <br/>
  Always associate a `<label>` with every form control
  (`<input>`, `<select>`,
  `<textarea>`) using the `for` attribute
  linking to the control's `id`. This improves usability and
  accessibility.
* ### Validate Your HTML
  <br/>
  Regularly check your HTML code for errors using validation tools. This
  helps catch syntax mistakes, missing attributes, or improper element
  nesting that could cause rendering issues or accessibility problems.
  (More on validation below).
* ### Declare the Correct Doctype
  <br/>
  Always start your HTML document with
  `<!DOCTYPE html>` to ensure browsers render the page
  in standards mode (using the latest HTML5 rules).
* ### Specify Character Encoding
  <br/>
  Include `<meta charset="UTF-8">` within the
  `<head>` section. UTF-8 supports a vast range of
  characters and prevents display issues with special characters or
  different languages.
* ### Set the Document Language
  <br/>
  Use the `lang` attribute on the
  `<html>` tag (e.g.,
  `<html lang="en">`) to indicate the primary language
  of the page content. This helps browsers, translation tools, and
  assistive technologies.
* ### Maintain Proper Nesting and Closing Tags
  <br/>
  Ensure all elements are properly nested (tags opened inside others
  must be closed before the outer tag closes) and that all non-empty
  elements have a corresponding closing tag.
  <br/>
  *Sample Code*
  ```html
  <p>Here is some <strong>important</strong> text.</p>

  <p>Here is some <strong>important text.</strong> </p>
  ```
* ### Use Comments Wisely
  <br/>
  Use HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`) to explain complex
  sections of code, note temporary changes, or add reminders. Avoid
  over-commenting simple code. Remember comments are visible in the page
  source.
* ### Separate Structure (HTML), Presentation (CSS), and Behavior (JavaScript)
  <br/>
  Avoid using inline styles (`style="..."` attribute) or
  inline event handlers (`onclick="..."` attribute)
  extensively in your HTML. Keep styling in separate CSS files and
  scripting in separate JavaScript files for better organization and
  maintainability. We'll touch on linking these in the next lessons.
* ### Minimize Inline Elements for Block Layout
  <br/>
  Don't use inline elements like **`<span>`** or
  **`<br>`** to create block-level spacing or layout. Use
  CSS properties like `margin`, `padding`, and
  layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid) on block-level or semantic elements.

## HTML Validation
<section id="html-validation" />

HTML validation is the process of checking your HTML code against the
official standards defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
Validators are tools that analyze your code and report errors or
warnings based on these standards.

**Why Validate?**

* **Catch Errors:** Finds syntax errors like unclosed tags,
  improperly nested elements, missing required attributes, or typos.
* **Ensure Consistency:** Helps ensure your page will
  render more predictably across different browsers, as browsers are
  generally built to handle valid code better.
* **Improve Accessibility:** Many validation errors
  correspond to accessibility issues (e.g., missing alt text, incorrect
  form labeling).
* **Future-Proofing:** Valid code is more likely to work
  correctly with future browser versions and web technologies.
* **Debugging Aid:** Validation errors often point directly
  to the source of rendering problems.

### How to Validate

The most common way is to use the official W3C Markup Validation
Service:

* **Website:**
  [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
* **Methods:** You can validate by:
  + Entering the URL (URI) of a live webpage.
  + Uploading an HTML file.
  + Pasting your HTML code directly into a text area ("Validate by
    Direct Input").

There are also browser extensions and built-in tools in some code
editors that can perform HTML validation.

Aim to fix all errors reported by the validator. Warnings are
suggestions and might not always indicate a critical problem, but they
are worth reviewing.

## Examples of Common Validation Errors
<section id="examples-of-common-validation-errors" />

### Example 1: Unclosed Tag
*Sample Code*
```html
<p>This paragraph is missing its closing tag.
<div>This div is inside the unclosed paragraph.</div>
```

**Correct Version:**

```html
<p>This paragraph has its closing tag.</p>
<div>This div is now properly outside the paragraph.</div>
```

### Example 2: Missing Required Attribute (alt on img)
*Sample Code*
```html
<img src="logo.png">
```
**Correct Version:**

```html
<img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo"> <img src="decoration.png" alt="">
```

### Example 3: Improper Nesting
*Sample Code*
```html
<!-- ❌ Incorrect nesting: <em> is closed after </strong> -->
<p>Here is <strong>some text <em>that is nested</strong> incorrectly.</em></p>
```

**Correct Version:**

```html
<p>Here is <strong>some text <em>that is nested</em> correctly.</strong></p>
```
