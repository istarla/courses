# Basic HTML Structure

## Anatomy of an HTML Element


As we touched upon before, an HTML element usually consists of a
start tag, content, and an end tag. Let's delve deeper into this:

* Start Tag: It marks the beginning
  of an element and is enclosed in angle brackets (e.g.,
  `<p>`).
* Content: This is the information
  that appears between the start and end tags (e.g., "This is a
  paragraph.").
* End Tag: It marks the end of an
  element. End tags look like start tags but have a forward slash before
  the element name (e.g., `</p>`).

For example, in `<h1>My Main Title</h1>`,
`<h1>` is the start tag, "My Main Title" is the
content, and `</h1>` is the end tag.

## Nesting HTML Elements


HTML elements can be nested within each other. This means you can have
one element inside another. Proper nesting is crucial for the browser to
correctly interpret your HTML structure.

*Sample Code*
```html
<div style="border:1px solid blue;">
    <p>This paragraph is inside a <strong>div</strong> element.</p>
</div>
```
**Output:**
<div style={{border:"1px solid blue"}}>
    <p>This paragraph is inside a <strong>div</strong> element.</p>
</div>
<br/>

In this example, the `<p>` element and the
`<strong>` element are nested within the
`<div>` element. It's important to close the inner
elements before closing the outer ones. Incorrect nesting can lead to
unexpected behavior and make your HTML harder to read and maintain.

*Sample Code*
```html
<!-- Incorrect Nesting -->
<p><strong>This is bold text.</p></strong>

<!-- Correct Nesting -->
<p><strong>This is bold text.</strong></p>
```
**Output:**
<p><strong>This is bold text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is bold text.</strong></p>

Note: Both examples may look the same when rendered because browsers
automatically fix invalid nesting.
However, the first example is not valid HTML — it breaks the
logical tag structure. Always close inner elements before closing the
outer ones to ensure cleaner, predictable, and accessible HTML.

## Block-Level vs. Inline Elements


HTML elements can be categorized into two main types based on how they
behave in terms of layout: block-level and inline elements.

### Block-Level Elements


* Block-level elements always start on a new line and take up the full
  width available (stretching out to the left and right as far as they
  can).
* They can contain both inline and other block-level elements.
* Examples of common block-level elements include:
  `<div>`, `<p>`,
  `<h1>` to `<h6>`,
  `<ul>`, `<ol>`,
  `<li>`, `<form>`,
  `<header>`, `<footer>`,
  `<section>`.

*Sample Code*
```html
<div style="border: 1px solid red;">This is a block-level div.</div>
<p style="border: 1px solid green;">This is a block-level paragraph.</p>
```
**Output:**
<div style={{ border: "1px solid red" }}>This is a block-level div.</div>
<p style={{ border: "1px solid green" }}>This is a block-level paragraph.</p>


### Inline Elements


* Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much
  width as necessary.
* They typically contain only data or other inline elements.
* Examples of common inline elements include: `<span>`,
  `<a>`, `<strong>`,
  `<em>`, `<img>`,
  `<input>`, `<textarea>`,
  `<select>`.

*Sample Code*
```html
<span style="border: 1px solid blue;">This is an inline span.</span>
<strong style="border: 1px solid orange;">This is inline bold text.</strong>
```
<p>**Conceptual output:**</p>
<span style={{border: "1px solid blue"}}>This is an inline span.</span>
<strong style={{border: "1px solid orange"}}>This is inline bold text.</strong>

Understanding the difference between block-level and inline elements is
crucial for controlling the layout and structure of your web pages.

## Attributes


Attributes provide extra information about HTML elements. They are
always specified in the start tag. Attributes usually come in name/value
pairs like: `name="value"`.

* Common Attributes: Some common
  attributes include `id` (to uniquely identify an element),
  `class` (to classify elements), `style` (to add
  inline styles), `src` (for images), `href` (for
  links), and `alt` (for image descriptions).
* Global Attributes: These are
  attributes that can be used on almost any HTML element (e.g.,
  `id`, `class`, `style`,
  `title`, `lang`).

*Sample Code*
```html
<p id="intro" class="main-paragraph" style="color: green;">This paragraph has an ID, a class, and inline styling.</p>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="My Image" width="400">
<a href="https://www.example.com" title="Go to Example.com">Visit Example</a>
```
<p>**output:**</p>
<span id="intro" className="main-paragraph" style={{ color: "green" }}>This paragraph has an ID, a class, and inline styling.</span>

<img src="/src/courses/assets/images/image3.webp" alt="My Image" width="400" />

<a href="https://www.example.com" title="Go to Example.com">
  Visit Example
</a>


## Comments in HTML


HTML comments are used to insert explanatory notes in the code. They are
ignored by the browser and are not displayed on the page. Comments are
very useful for documenting your code and making it easier to
understand.

*Sample Code*
```html
<!-- This is an HTML comment -->
<p>This paragraph is not a comment.</p>
<!--
    This is a
    multi-line
    HTML comment.
-->
```
**Output:**
<p>This paragraph is not a comment.</p>

## Examples


### Example 1: A Nested Structure
*Sample Code*
```html
<article>
    <h2>Article Title</h2>
    <p>This is the main content of the article. <em>It includes emphasized text.</em></p>
</article>
```
**Output:**
<article>
    <h2>Article Title</h2>
    <p>This is the main content of the article. <em>It includes emphasized text.</em></p>
</article>

### Example 2: Block and Inline Elements
*Sample Code*
```html
<div style="background-color: #eee; padding: 10px;">
    This is a <span style="color: blue;">block-level</span> element containing an
    <strong>inline</strong> element.
</div>
```
<p>**output:**</p>
<div style={{ backgroundColor: "#eee", padding: "10px" }}>
  This is a <span style={{ color: "blue" }}>block-level</span> element containing an{" "}
  <strong>inline</strong> element.
</div>


### Example 3: Using Attributes
*Sample Code*
```html
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools</a>
<!--
    - href: specifies the URL of the link.
    - target="_blank": opens the link in a new tab.
-->
```
<p>**output:**</p>
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools</a>
