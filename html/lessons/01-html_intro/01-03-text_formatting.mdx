# Text Formatting in HTML

## Structuring Content with Headings and Paragraphs


Well-structured content is easier to read and understand, both for users
and search engines. HTML provides tags specifically for creating
headings and paragraphs.

* **Headings (`<h1>` to
  `<h6>`):**
  These tags define headings. `<h1>` represents the
  most important heading (usually the main title of the page or
  section), and `<h6>` represents the least important.
  Browsers typically display headings in larger and bolder fonts than
  normal text. It's crucial to use headings hierarchically (don't skip
  levels, e.g., go from an `<h1>` directly to an
  `<h3>` without an `<h2>`). There
  should generally be only one `<h1>` per page.
* **Paragraphs (`<p>`):** This tag defines
  a paragraph of text. Browsers automatically add some vertical space
  (margin) before and after each paragraph. Any block of text that forms
  a distinct paragraph should be wrapped in `<p>` tags.

## Basic Text Styling: Bold, Italic, Underline, etc.


HTML offers several tags to change the appearance or semantic meaning of
text within a block (like a paragraph). These are often called "inline"
elements.

<table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Tag</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Typical Browser Rendering</th>
            <th>Semantic Meaning</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Marks text with strong importance.</td>
            <td>Bold</td>
            <td>Indicates significant importance, seriousness, or urgency.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>&lt;b&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Stylistically offsets text (historically "bold").</td>
            <td>Bold</td>
            <td>
              Draws attention without implying extra importance (e.g., keywords,
              product names). Use <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> if importance is
              intended.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>&lt;em&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Marks text with emphasis.</td>
            <td>Italic</td>
            <td>
              Indicates stress emphasis, changing the meaning of the sentence.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>&lt;i&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Stylistically offsets text (historically "italic").</td>
            <td>Italic</td>
            <td>
              Represents text in an alternate voice or mood (e.g., technical
              terms, foreign words, thoughts). Use <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> if
              emphasis is intended.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>&lt;u&gt;</code></td>
            <td>
              Represents text with an unarticulated, non-textual annotation
              (historically "underline").
            </td>
            <td>Underline</td>
            <td>
              Often used for things like marking misspelled words or proper
              names in Chinese text. Avoid using it purely for decoration, as
              users often associate underlines with hyperlinks.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>&lt;mark&gt;</code></td>
            <td>
              Represents text marked or highlighted for reference or notation
              purposes.
            </td>
            <td>Highlighted background (often yellow)</td>
            <td>
              Indicates text relevance in a specific context (e.g., highlighting
              search terms in results).
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>&lt;sub&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Defines subscript text.</td>
            <td>Lowered, smaller font</td>
            <td>
              Used for chemical formulas (H<sub>2</sub>O), mathematical
              variables, etc.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>&lt;sup&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Defines superscript text.</td>
            <td>Raised, smaller font</td>
            <td>
              Used for exponents (x<sup>2</sup>), footnotes, ordinal numbers
              (1<sup>st</sup>), etc.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>&lt;small&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Represents side comments or small print.</td>
            <td>Smaller font size</td>
            <td>
              Used for things like copyright notices or legal disclaimers.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>&lt;del&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Represents deleted text.</td>
            <td>Strikethrough</td>
            <td>
              Indicates text that has been removed or is no longer accurate.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code>&lt;ins&gt;</code></td>
            <td>Represents inserted text.</td>
            <td>Underline (often)</td>
            <td>
              Indicates text that has been added to the document. Often used
              with <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      
**Important Note:** While tags like
`<b>` and `<i>` primarily define
presentation (bold, italic), tags like `<strong>` and
`<em>` carry semantic meaning (importance, emphasis).
It's generally better to use the semantic tags when the meaning applies,
as this benefits accessibility (screen readers can convey
importance/emphasis) and search engines. Use `<b>` and
`<i>` when there's no change in meaning, just style.
For most styling, CSS is the preferred method, but these HTML tags are
useful for specific semantic or stylistic inline adjustments.

## Line Breaks and Horizontal Rules


* **Line Break (`<br>`):** This is an
  empty tag (no closing tag needed) that forces a line break within a
  block of text (like inside a paragraph). Use it sparingly; if you need
  separate blocks of text, use multiple `<p>` tags.
  It's useful for things like addresses or poetry where line structure
  matters within a single block.
* **Horizontal Rule (`<hr>`):** This empty
  tag represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements. It's
  typically rendered as a horizontal line across the page. Use it to
  indicate a shift in topic or scene.

## Examples


### Example 1: Headings, Paragraphs, and Basic Styling
*sample Code*
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Text Formatting Example 1</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Main Page Title (h1)</h1>
    <p>This is the introductory paragraph. It provides context for the page.</p>

    <h2>A Major Section (h2)</h2>
    <p>This paragraph discusses the first main topic. We can use <strong>strong importance</strong> for key concepts and <em>emphasis</em> for stressed words. Sometimes, you might just want to draw attention using <b>bold</b> or <i>italics</i> for terms.</p>

    <h3>A Subsection (h3)</h3>
    <p>More details under the subsection. Let's highlight <mark>this important finding</mark>.</p>

    <h2>Another Major Section (h2)</h2>
    <p>Concluding thoughts.</p>
</body>
