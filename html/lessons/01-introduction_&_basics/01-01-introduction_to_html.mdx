# Introduction to HTML & Web Basics

## What is HTML?
<section-anchor id="what-is-html" />
HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It's the
standard markup language used to create and structure content on the
World Wide Web. Think of it as the skeleton or the blueprint of a
webpage.

It's not a programming language like Python or Java, meaning it doesn't
have logic like loops or conditional statements. Instead, HTML uses
"markup" - a system of tags - to describe the structure and meaning of
web content. Browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari) read HTML files and
render them into the visual webpages we see.

* **HyperText:** Refers to links that connect web pages to
  one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links
  are a fundamental aspect of the Web.
* **Markup Language:** Means you use HTML to simply "mark
  up" a text document with tags that tell a web browser how to structure
  it for display.

## How the Web Works (Simplified)
<section-anchor id="how-the-web-works" />

When you type a web address (URL) like `www.google.com` into
your browser:

1. **Request:** Your browser sends a request over the
   internet to a special computer called a
   **web server** where the website's files (including HTML
   files) are stored.
2. **Server Processing:** The web server finds the requested
   HTML file (e.g., `index.html`).
3. **Response:** The server sends the HTML file (and
   potentially other files like CSS for styling and JavaScript for
   interactivity) back to your browser.
4. **Rendering:** Your browser reads the HTML code to
   understand the structure (headings, paragraphs, images, etc.) and then
   displays the webpage visually on your screen.

HTML provides the structure, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) adds the style
(colors, fonts, layout), and JavaScript adds interactivity (animations,
dynamic updates). We'll focus solely on HTML for now.

## Introduction to Browser Developer Tools
<section-anchor id="browser-developer-tools" />
Every modern web browser comes with built-in "Developer Tools" (often
called DevTools). These tools are essential for web developers to
inspect, debug, and understand how webpages are built.

**How to open DevTools:**

* Right-click on any webpage element and select "Inspect" or "Inspect
  Element".
* Press the F12 key on your keyboard (common on Windows).
* Use keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Opt+I
  (Mac).

**Key Features (Focus on Elements/Inspector):**

* **Elements (or Inspector) Panel:** Shows the live HTML
  structure of the page. You can see the tags, attributes, and content.
  You can even temporarily edit the HTML here to see how changes affect
  the page (these changes are temporary and reset on page reload).
* **Styles Panel (within Elements):** Shows the CSS rules
  applied to the selected HTML element.
* **Console Panel:** Used mainly for JavaScript errors and
  logging, but useful to know it exists.

Get comfortable opening and exploring the DevTools on different
websites. It's like looking under the hood of a car!

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic HTML Structure Concept

This isn't a full HTML file yet, but illustrates the idea of tags
marking up content.

*Sample Code:*
```html
<h1>This is a Main Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph of text. HTML uses tags like <p> to define content blocks.</p>
<p>Another paragraph.</p>
```

**Rendered Output:**
<>
<h1>This is a Main Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph of text. HTML uses tags like `<p>` to define content blocks.</p>
<p>Another paragraph.</p>
</>

Here, `<h1>` and `</h1>` mark the text
between them as a level 1 heading. `<p>` and
`</p>` mark text as paragraphs.

### Example 2: Identifying HTML in DevTools

**Step-1:** Open any webpage (e.g., google.com).

**Step-2:** Right-click on the main logo or search bar.

**Step-3:** Select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element".

**Step-4:** Observe the HTML code highlighted in the Elements panel. You'll see
tags like `<img>` (for the logo image) or
`<input>` (for the search bar). This is the underlying
HTML structure the browser uses.

(No code block needed here as it's an action to perform).

### Example 3: Client-Server Interaction Analogy

Think of ordering a pizza:

1. **You (Browser):** Decide you want pizza (a webpage) and
   call the pizza place (enter URL/click link).
2. **Phone Call (Request):** You tell the order taker what
   you want (requesting a specific HTML page).
3. **Pizza Place (Web Server):** Receives your order, finds
   the recipe (HTML file), and makes the pizza (processes the request).
4. **Delivery Driver (Response):** Brings the pizza (HTML
   file and other assets) to your house.
5. **Eating the Pizza (Rendering):** You open the box and
   see the pizza arranged (Browser displays the webpage based on HTML
   structure).
